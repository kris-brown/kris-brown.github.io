You use a representation of that rule to train the next generation to follow the rule. How do we know that the same rule is being passed on? Isn't it like a game of telephone, given the ambiguity of following rules (gerrymandering problem - you have a rule in your head and punish me for lifting the glass of water, but I interpret this as punishment for lifting my arm or one of a million other\npossible explanations). [Brandom](people/Robert%20Brandom.md)'s response:\n\nWell, maybe so and maybe it a given rule isn't as stable as we think. I mean,\nit's only if it had enough coherence and enough stability, that we're here.\n(Anthropomorphic principle). And when [Wittgenstein](people/Ludwig%20Wittgenstein.md) harps on this, you know, unless\nas a matter of fact, we tended to go on the same way when trained the same way,\nto a remarkable extent, we wouldn't get a language game off the ground.\n\nThis [gerrymandering](Disjunctivitis.md) issue is what was wrong with classical behaviorism from an empirical point of view. [^1] Remember, the stimulus and response were supposed to be objective features of the critters you were looking at. So that the behavioral scientist modeled on the natural scientist, her own conceptual scheme was not supposed to be involved in characterizing the behavior of these critters. But if you ask sort of classical studies, so I take the rat, and set him down four steps away from the bar, and train him, then if he walks four steps forward and presses down on the bar, he'll get a rat yummy. And that stimulus, let's say, the light goes on, walks, four steps, pushes down on the bar gets a rat yummy. We indoctrinate him with that, conditioned learning, he can do that. And now we ask the behavioral scientist. And now if I put in eight steps away from the bar, what do you predict he's going to do? Is he going to go four steps forward and move his paw up and down? Is that the behavior that has been associated with the stimulus? Or would you predict that he'll go eight steps forward and press down on the bar. That is, the right description is that he'll go from where he is to the bar and press on the bar? Well, the minute you think about this, you realize that we can gerrymander, what he was taught, there are many descriptions, that that are available to us for what he was taught. And in fact, no one who works with the animals would expect him to move four steps forward, and not be pressing on the bar. But why is that? Is that something that you without importing any understanding of this are objectively reading off of the situation? Or have you, in fact, all along been importing, your characterization of what the regularity is that you are, that you're characterizing? This is actually empirical as well as a methodological problem. What is the prediction that you're supposed to make at this point? And how do you justify the one rather than rather than the other by your methodological lights?\n\n[^1]: What was wrong with classical behaviorism, from a *conceptual* point of view, is we can see it with the wisdom of hindsight is just a larval stage on the way to functionalism. As all of the considerations that lead people to think have direct stimulus response connections, are satisfied still, if you allow intervening states.  It's still an empirical undertaking, and so on. But there's a lot more formal power, you can get Turing machines, if you can get functional states, so you can get a lot farther. That's why nobody should be a classical behaviorist anymore: be a functionalist, you get all the advantages, and a lot more expressive power.\n\n# External resources\n\n* [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/behaviorism/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.38103606-08:00","tags":null},"/Concepts":{"title":"Concepts","content":"\n# External resources\n\n* [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.401967788-08:00","tags":null},"/Declarativism":{"title":"Declarativism","content":"\nAll [declarative sentences](Declarative%20sentences.md) should be put in a box, i.e. given a uniform [semantics](Semantics.md). \n\nFurthermore, this semantics should be that they should be thought of as \"fact-stating\", a paradigm example being \"the frog is on the log\".\n\nThis can be argued for via the [Frege-Geach argument](Frege-Geach%20argument.md).

Rationalists treat reason relations as primitive, explain representational content in terms of inferential relations.\n  * Rationalist [Leibniz](../people/Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz.md) would have us understand the content of the [map](../Maps.md) as the inferences that someone who treats it as a map could make about terrain facts (e.g. a river) from map-facts (wavy-blue line).\n* Sellars identifies both camps as [descriptivists](../Descriptivism.md)[^dr] (to be conceptually contentful is just to describe / represent how things are).\n  * Empiricists start with narrow postulate about what representing is and exclude a lot of genuinely contentful thought due to not meeting this standard (e.g. ethics, modality).\n  * Rationalists take all our cognitively contentful expressions as therefore being part of the actual world, resulting in ontological extravagance (postulating objective values/universals/propositions/laws).\n  * Sellars saw the Tractatus as teaching us how to get beyond this ideology with the case of logical vocabulary ([quote](../quotes/Logic%20not%20representational.md)).\n\n[^dr]: : Note that representation is a slightly wider concept than description, but anti-descriptivism is a can still be viewed as a form of anti-representationalism.\n\n## Lessons\n\n* Representation is a holistic conception, so rationalists were just right about that. \n  * Kant's trancendental unity of apperception is a holistic one\n  * Hegel is the one who built this wholism into the ground floor of his philosophical idiom\n* Representation / description involve subjunctively-robust relations between representings and representeds.\n  * This is a dangerous thought if you are an empiricist: it means representation is not a purely descriptive notion.\n  * Considering Leibniz's example of the inferences of map facts to terrain facts, we also must accept that if the terrain were different, the map fact would be different.\n  * Related to [Fodor](../people/Jerry%20Fodor.md)'s account of representation in terms of \"one-way counterfactual dependencies of 'horses' on horses\".\n* The [normative character of representation](../Normative%20character%20of%20representation.md)\n  * To treat representation as concerning what inferences we can make is a normative order.\n  * Kant saw that the [order and connection of ideas](../quotes/Order%20and%20connection%20of%20ideas.md) is a normative order.

(His [Refutation of Idealism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental/#RefIde) is quite short).\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.381027726-08:00","tags":null},"/antirep2020/05-Rortys-Literary-Turn":{"title":"05 - Rorty's Literary Turn","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](04-%20%20Cheryl%20Misak's%20Critique%20of%20Rorty's%20Pragmatism.md) [Next](06%20-%20Rorty's%20Political%20Turn.md)\n\nRorty's literary kehre lasted 10 years. But he realized he's an analytic philosopher and that literary theorists didn't know how to make distinctions and were not good to talk to. He then had a political kehre (had extended interactions with Habermas).\n\n# Rorty's argument\n\nHere are five claims or moves Rorty might be seen to be making:\n\n1. Rejecting two-stage talk of two activities, one of instituting meanings and the other of applying them to justify beliefs. [^tde]\n1. Rejecting the language/theory distinction entirely, in favor of the ‘vocabulary’ vocabulary. All we do is use vocabularies, and those practices both institute meanings and apply concepts to undertake commitments (endorse, take-true, some claimables).\n1. Rejecting the Kantian problematic of assigning responsibility for some features of our discourse (vocabulary-use) to what we are talking about (what is represented)—the authority of the objective—and responsibility for other features of our discourse to us— the authority of the subjective.\n1. Rejecting as ultimately unintelligible the idea that our thought is normatively constrained (as opposed to causally constrained) by an objective world via the representational semantic dependence of representings on representeds that consists in representeds providing normative standards of assessment of the correctness of representings (in a distinctive sense of “correctness.”). This is a kind of authority of representeds over representings.\n1. Social pragmatism about normativity: all normative statuses (responsibility, authority, being a standard of correctness) are social statuses.\n\n[^tde]: The appeal here is to Quine’s pragmatist arguments in [Two Dogmas of Empiricism](../works/Two%20Dogmas%20of%20Empiricism.md).\n\n# RR on Romanticism\n\nMediating between idealism and pragmatism.\n\nRomanticism has idealist and pragmatist tendencies. Idealism corresponds to [weak textualism](../quotes/Strong%20and%20weak%20textualists.md), while pragmatism to strong. The weak ones haven't freed themselves from Philosophy.\n\nRorty gives a [redescription of Nietzsche](../quotes/Pragmatism%20and%20Nietzsche.md), an example of the kind of strong textualism which takes a text and beats it into a shape to suit the reader's purpose, imposing his own vocabulary on it.\n\nRorty [reconstructs](../quotes/Hegel%20literary%20genre.md) a progression from *idealism* to *romanticism* to *pragmatism*.\n\nRorty makes a number of claims:\n\n1. [all problems, topics, and distinctions are language-relative](../quotes/Textualists%20and%20language%20relativity.md)\n1. [criticizing any philosophical view that presupposes an objectively privileged vocabulary (simply in virtue of its relation to its subject matter)](../quotes/Strong%20and%20weak%20textualists.md)\n1. [the vocabulary of science is merely one among others](../quotes/Romanticism%20as%20vocabulary%20over%20truth.md)\n   * The privilege that science (controlling nature) has is not inherently privileged over other possible advantages other vocabularies have\n1. Romanticism defined as \"the one thing needful was to discover not which propositions are true but rather what vocabulary we should use.\"\n\nWhat's important about being human is our ability to self-transform, redescribe.  Romanticism was important because of its focus on that capacity as the center of human aspiration, rather than getting things right representationally.\n\nRorty has a notion of a \"presiding cultural discipline\" - since the Enlightenment it has been science, but in the future it could be literature. Science was emancipatory at the start of the Enlightenment, but by the end of the 19th century it became constraining.\n\n## Danger: backsliding into Carnappian pragmatism\n\nRorty says that what the romantics discovered that we are free to pick our vocabulary.\n\nTreating vocabularies as if they are languages that we are free to chose from is dangersouly close to Carnappian pragmatism. This is a misuse of the vocabulary vocabulary because it violates Quine's anti-Carnap lesson.\n\n# Criticism of \"There is nothing outside of the text\"[^mcd]\n\nRorty classifies this claim of [Derrida](../people/Jaques%20Derrida.md) as \"weak textualism\" and sees it as backsliding into representationalist philosophy.\n\n[Author](../people/Richard%20Rorty.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e Occasionally a great physicist or a great critic comes along and gives us a new vocabulary which enables us to do a lot of new and marvelous things. Then we may exclaim that we have now found out the true nature of matter, or poetry, or whatever. But Hegel's ghost, embodied in Kuhn's romantic philosophy of science or Bloom's philosophy of romantic poetry, reminds us that vocabularies are as mortal as men. The pragmatist reminds us that a new and useful vocabulary is just that, not a sudden unmediated vision of things or texts as they are.\n \u003e \n \u003e As usual with pithy little formulae, the Derridean claim that \"There is nothing outside the text\" is right about what it implicitly denies and wrong about what it explicitly asserts. The only force of saying that texts do not refer to non-texts is just the old pragmatist chestnut that any specification of a referent is going to be in some vocabulary. Thus one is really comparing to descriptions of a thing rather than a description with the thing-in-itself.\n \u003e \n \u003e This chestnut, in turn, is just an expanded form of Kant's slogan that \"Intuitions without concepts are blind,\" which, in turn, was just a sophisticated restatement of Berkeley's ingenuous remark that \"nothing can be like an idea except an idea.\"\n \u003e \n \u003e These are all merely misleading ways of saying that we shall not see reality plain, unmasked, naked to our gaze.\n \u003e \n \u003e Textualism has nothing to add to this claim except a new misleading image—the image of the world as consisting of everything written in all the vocabularies used so far.\n \u003e ...\n \u003e Textualism adds nothing save an extra metaphor to the romanticism of Hegel and the pragmatism of James and Nietzsche...\n\n— [Nineteenth Century Idealism and Twentieth Century Textualism](../works/Nineteenth%20Century%20Idealism%20and%20Twentieth%20Century%20Textualism.md)\n\n[^mcd]: Note that McDowell centrally claims \"The conceptual has no outer boundary\" in [Mind and World](../works/Mind%20and%20World.md)\n\nSome background for Derrida's claim:\n\nHe is working in a post-structuralist environment. Their principal tool is de Saussure's signifier/signified model.\n\nThis is a linguistic version of Berekle's \"it's representings all the way down\" idealism.\n\nDerrida restricts it to just the signifier side. Brandom: \"If we really understand structuralism (thinking of the functional roles of signifiers) we'll see that there is only the signifiers to worry about\".\n\nBrandom says this model is semantically inadequate as a model and not even a radical rejection of the signifier/signified model. He wants to file it away in a cabinet labeled \"How not to be an antirepresentationalist\".\n\nPierce said similar things about interpretants and interpreters. His principal admirer Charles Morris used this notion of the name-bearer relation to found semiotics, which is not a successful field.\n\nThis is not just [representationalism](../Representationalism.md), it is nominalistic representationalism (Taking tha name-bearer relationship as the semantic paradigm). It is all pre-kantian, preFregegian, preWittgensteinien.\n\n* Kant: the judgment is the smallest unit of awareness/consciouness (and committment, the smallest thing we can be held responsible for). We can only understand names in terms of the roles they play in reasoning. \n* Frege: What's expressed by sentences is special/prior in order explanation to the semantic content of proper names. Because a declarative sentence is the smallest unit to which pragmatic force can attach.\n* Early Wittgenstein: prioritized propositional signs (saw the world as facts, not things). \n* Later Wittgenstein: the smallest move in a language game.\n\nBrandom calls it \"the worst combination\" to be declarativist, representationalist, and nominalist.\n\nTarskian model theory (and following it, possible worlds semantics) is *not* nominalistic: it starts with semantic relations understood nominalistically, but then it builds up representational readings of sentences as sets of models / possibles worlds (those are treated differently from the names)\n\nThere is a connection between this topic and the vocabularity-relativity / objectivity. One question we can ask: to what extent is the categorical-structure of the world a vocabulary-dependent phenomenon? \n\n* Ask how we are to address debate two ways of thinking of the objective world we are talking about: is it (as wittgenstein puts it) a world of facts or a world of things?\n  Rorty thinks, if you say it's a world of facts, you've conceded his antirepresentationalist point (because the notion of fact[^f] is a vocabulary-relative). \n\n[^f]: Frege says: a fact is a thought (i.e. thinkable) that is true.\n\nYou might try to avoid this by thinking of a world of objects, but objects are equally vocabulary-dependent. (you need *[sortals](../Sortals.md)* to distinguish objects).\n\n# Two senses of vocabulary-dependence\n\nThe way in which the law-like / categorial structure of the world *depends* on us is dependence in the order of understanding, not the order of being.\n\n\"There is nothing outside the text\" goes wrong because it seems like a claim of the order of *being*, not just explanation. It violates the lesson of [Lincoln's horse](../Lincoln's%20horse.md) example. This [confuses](../-ing%20vs%20-ed%20distinction.md) thinkings for thinkables.\n\n[Sense dependence vs reference](../interaction/Sense%20dependence%20vs%20reference.md) is relevent: One is frightened of claims of vocabulary dependence because one is thinking of reference- dependence claims. What is arguable is sense-dependence.\n\n* You can't understand the notion of a fact without understanding the notion of a declarative sentence\n* You can't understand the notion of an object without understanding a singular term + sortal in a language\n* You can't understand the concept of a law with understanding modally quantified conditionals.\n\nThere is a sense dependence[^ff] between concepts we use to articulate the categorial structure of the world and concepts we use to describe various features of vocabularies in use (grammatical categories).\n\nTo assert that sense dependence is *not* to assert a reference dependence.\n\n[^ff]: ==This is functorial==\n\nWhen someone makes a vocabulary-dependence claim\n(e.g. the lawfulness of a relation between two properties is a feature of our cognitive faculties) it makes a big difference whether this is a sense or reference dependence claim.\n\n* Without understanding what it is for you to follow a rule / to infer $B$ from $A$, you can't *understand* the lawfulness that you're taking the world to have.\n* This does not entail a reference dependence.\n\nWe need to be careful when reading Rorty (who doesn't explicitly make this distinction) that we are not accepting his claims (as plausible because they are sense-dependence) and then letting him draw consequences from them (as if they were reference-dependence).\n\nBrandom suggests that to understand the notion of a fact, one needs to understand the notion of a judgment (and vice-versa). Likewise, to understand the notion of an object and to understand the notion of a singular term in a language also must be understood together (two sides of one coin).\n\n# Pragmatist conceptual progress\n\n[Author](../people/Richard%20Rorty.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e In the final sentence of his book, Putnam says that, \"The very fact that we speak of our different conceptions as different conceptions of rationality posits a Grenzbegriff, a limited-concept of ideal truth.\" But what is such a posit supposed to do, except to say that from God's point of view the human race is heading in the right direction?...\n \u003e \n \u003e To say that we think we're heading in the right direction is just to say, with Kuhn, that we can, by hindsight, tell the story of the past as a story of progress. To say that we still have a long way to go, that our present views should not be cast in bronze, is too platitudinous to require support by positing limit-concepts. So it is hard to see what difference is made by the difference between saying \"there is only the dialogue\" and saying \"there is also that to which the dialogue converges.\"\n \u003e \n \u003e Positing *Grenzbegriffe* seems merely a way of telling ourselves that a nonexistent God would, if he did exist, be pleased with us. If we could ever be moved solely by the desire for solidarity, setting aside the desire for objectivity altogether, then we should think of human progress as making it possible for human beings to do more interesting things and be more interesting people, not as heading toward a place that has somehow been prepared for humanity in advance. Our self-image would employ images of making rather than finding, the images used by the Romantics to praise poets rather than the images used by the Greeks to praise mathematicians.\n\n— [Solidarity or Objectivity](../works/Solidarity%20or%20Objectivity.md)\n\nWe can only tell progress (that one vocabulary is an improvement) *retrospectively*, from within our current vocabulary. There's nothing outside the dialogue.\n\nBut we can imagine institutions of science being taken over by religious fanatics. They'll be able to make a retrospective story too. Rorty has to say \"We hope that this won't happen, but history is written by the victors.\"\n\nBrandom challenges this and offers a pragmatist-sanitized notion of *pro*spective, technological progress.\n\n* The new technology has to be able to do what we're already doing (better than we can).\n* This is evaluated in *our* current vocabulary.\n* This sorts future retrospective stories into good or bad from our perspective.\n\nThis is what persuaded the conquering Arabs to keep Greek learning - they *knew* Greek medicine could save people from battlefield wounds that were otherwise surely fatal. When the Greek doctors said that to understand how, you needed to think about how the microcosm and the macrocosm were related, the Arabs had little choice but to think that all that Greek literature and philosophy must be valuable and should be preserved. Aristotle would not be able to appreciate how accurately we can measure the mass of the electron. But he would be impressed by our medicine, by our ability to blow large holes in the ground, move things rapidly over great distances, build large, stable structures...and so on.\n\nThe demand for technological conservation and progress, understood by prospective normative standards set by earlier practical attitudes and assessments puts a genuine constraint on what counts as theoretical progress, understood by retrospective normative standards set by later practical attitudes and assessments.\n\nWe could *define* technological progress as that which can be measured prospectively.[^tp] Then we can make it a criterion of adequacy for a good \"retrospective story\" that it must be technologically progressive (in domains of the empirical world). We might not care, e.g. for poetic traditions, that we preserve prospective progress. \n\n[^tp]: This would be what we call \"technological progress\" in our *current* vocabulary\n\nBrandom ties this to Pierce's theory of progress. What is prospectively assessible is a constraint on what is retrospectively assessible. This is a way to not be mere carnappian progress but see real friction between vocabularies in use (without thinking in representationalist terms).\n\n# Pragmatist version of Kantian problematic\n\nBrandom suggests that we can accept the vocabulary vocabulary without drawing Rorty's conclusion that we need to move beyond the Kantian problematic.\n\nExample of counting apples: each community which can do this has a different ordered set of expressions (\"1,2,3...\", \"$\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$...\", etc). But each community says there is the same count of apples. It seems like it is up to us how to count the apples but the actual count is vocabulary independent.\n\nIt's through understanding relationships between the vocabularies that we can achieve something vocabulary independent (e.g. the isomorphism between \"1,2,3...\" and \"$\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma$...\").\n\nYou say \"it weighs 1\" and I say \"no it ways 2.2\" - what has to be true about our practice for someone outside us to say \"they are both measuring *the (objective) weight* (with units lb and kg)\". This requires ground-level pragmatism engineering to find out such-and-such properties need to preserved in the language mapping . \n\n==This is saying that a pragmatist strategy for making an objective/subjective distinction is via mappings between languages (characterizable via universal properties?)==\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.401970122-08:00","tags":null},"/antirep2020/09-Huw-Price-on-Representationalism-Rorty-and-Expressivism":{"title":"09 - Huw Price on Representationalism, Rorty, and Expressivism","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](08%20-%20Anti-Representationalism,%20Pragmatism,%20and%20Expressivism.md) [Next](10%20-%20Simon%20Blackburn%20on%20Expressivism%20and%20Pragmatism.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.341230234-08:00","tags":null},"/antirep2020/10-Simon-Blackburn-on-Expressivism-and-Pragmatism":{"title":"10 - Simon Blackburn on Expressivism and Pragmatism","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](09%20-%20Huw%20Price%20on%20Representationalism,%20Rorty,%20and%20Expressivism.md) [Next](11%20-%20Price%20on%20Sellars%20and%20McDowell,%20Blackburn%20on%20Brandom%20and%20McDowell.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.361093459-08:00","tags":null},"/antirep2020/12-Prices-Pragmatist-Philosophy-of-Language":{"title":"12 - Price's Pragmatist Philosophy of Language","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](11%20-%20Price%20on%20Sellars%20and%20McDowell,%20Blackburn%20on%20Brandom%20and%20McDowell.md) [Next](13%20-%20Global%20or%20Local%20Expressivism%3F%20The%20Current%20State%20of%20Play.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.404466962-08:00","tags":null},"/antirep2020/13-Global-or-Local-Expressivism-The-Current-State-of-Play":{"title":"13 - Global or Local Expressivism?

Has certain normative content he doesn't like (big disjunctive list)\n     * Egalitarianism\n     * High value on pity / altruism\n     * Especially high value on happiness / low value on suffering\n     * E.g. Nietzsche is a critic of utilitarianism, which might have some \n       but not all of these features\n\n# Naturalism about morality\n\n* Leitner calls Nietzsche a naturalist thinker about morality\n  * Thinking of him in line with Hume and Freud, rather than the popular view \n    of thinking of him as a precursor to postmodernism\n* \"Naturalist\" is a fraught term. Need to distinguish:\n  * \"substantive\"\n    * a certain ontological view (no 'supernatural' things exist)\n  * \"methodological\"\n    * an idea of how one does philosophy\n    * There aren't any distinctive philosophical practices, no difference in \n      kind with other sciences (primarily psychology)\n    * No reliance purely on *a priori*\n  * Nietzsche is at least the latter. Calls himself the 'first psychologist'\n  * He is a 'speculative methodological naturalist' like Hume.\n  * Same kind of structure of argument that is characteristic of Hume:\n    * Take some class of beliefs (e.g. beliefs of morality)\n    * Be skeptical that the beliefs can be rationally arrived at\n    * Construct a psychological narrative for how we could have arrived at \n      those beliefs / why they are attractive to human beings as they are.\n    * E.g. in geneology of morals: how did the acetic ideal come to dominate \n      the human mind / major religions.\n\n# What is the argument?\n\n* How would Nietzsche try to convince someone who believes in morality (in the \n  pejorative sense)?\n  * Leitner believes Nietzsche's goal is not to get everyone to give up on \n    morality.\n    * \"Herd morality for the herd\"\n    * There are different types of people\n  * But there are (potential) creative geniuses like Goethe, Napoleon, \n    Nietzsche himself, etc., whose flourishing is hindered by morality.\n  * Lots of techniques to convince those people.\n  * Nietzsche acknowledges that belief isn't an entirely (or even mostly) \n    rational deliberative process, so his methods of convincing are unusual \n    compared to other philosophers.\n  * Writes to 'get you in the gut' - is crude/rude/joking/hyperbolic.\n  * \"We don't even notice the slave morality because it's been victorious\" He \n    knows his readership isn't even skeptical of morality, so he needs to be \n    provocative to loosen them up / open them up to critical reflection.\n  * Makes arguments\n    * E.g. Naturalistic picture debunks common picture of human agency (his \n      readership is becoming more committed to science, which allows him to \n      draw up a tension)\n  * But you can't argue someone out of their morality, so rhetoric is important.\n\n# Is different types of good for different people self-contradictory?\n\n* Nietzsche wants different moralities for different types of people, but \n  maybe he's implicitly arguing for a universal principle \"what is good for \n  people is good for their individual fluorishing as the type of person they \n  are\"\n* Distinguish two kinds of goodness\n  1. prudential goodness, what is good for an individual (e.g. their \n     well-being)\n  1. moral goodness (all other types of goodness) (e.g. \"morality in the \n     pejorative sense ought be rejected because it prevents higher beings \n     from flourishing\")\n  * Nietzsche doesn't believe these claims are 'moral facts' (he's not a \n    moral realist)\n  * If a herd animal read Nietzsche's book and understood it perfectly but \n    reacted poorly (\"but this criticism of herd morality isn't good for the \n    rest of of us\") ... N would not think this person has made any error.\n  * Nietzsche thinks it's a matter of taste whether flourishing of higher \n    beings is more important than well-being of the herd.\n* So he is not aiming for a universal principle that is in the best interest \n  of everyone.\n\n# Relevance to contemporary analytic moral philosophy\n\n* Leitner: I don't think \"analytic philosophy\" exists, beyond some general \n  stylistic concerns like attempting to be clear.\n* There is a current strand of moral philosophy intersecting with psychology \n  that he would fit in with.\n* Nietzsche was a speculative naturalist, it's possible that his beliefs that \n  had empircal content are not psychological facts, but Leitner thinks after a \n  century of psychological research that Nietzsche was right often.\n  * E.g. he centred the role of the subconscious\n  * Among the three dominant paradigms of moral psychology, \n    [Aristotle](../people/Aristotle.md) / Kant / \n    Nietzsche, Nietzsche has the most plausible underlying assumptions given \n    what we now know about psychology.\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.320692423-08:00","tags":null},"/elucidations/34.-Moral-disagreement":{"title":"34.

Probability","content":"\n[Elucidations](Elucidations.md): Prev Next\n\n# Conflict between epistemic and objective notions of probability\n\n* In the former, to express a claim about a coin toss having a 50% chance of \n  being heads is to make a claim about a rational being's own knowledge, \n  among other things.\n* Intuitively, we'd prefer to just say probability is a fact in the world, \n  about a given chance mechanism.\n* However, we often harbor metaphysical notions of determinism: i.e. with full \n  information before the toss (placement of coin in the hand, facts about the \n  coin-tossers brain, etc.), we could deduce the outcome of the toss.\n  * This makes us believe that, objectively, the coin toss result being heads \n    is either 0 or 1. In general, there would be no non-extreme probabilities, \n    which is at odds with what makes probability theory useful.\n* Therefore, the desire to not step on determinism's toes historically has led \n  to a dominance of epistemic notions of probability.\n\n# Why not just submit to epistemic notion?\n\n* it would be remarkable if the ordinary claim that a coin toss is fair were \n  covertly a commentary on one's own ignorance.\n* analogy: whether or not we are justified in believing something depends on \n  our epistemic relation to the world. However, this doesn't mean that the \n  content of all our beliefs makes reference to our epistemic state.\n* But still, we then have to explain how to reconcile objective probability \n  with determinism.\n\n# Conflict between determinism and objective probability is an illusion due to a misconception about the content of judgments of probability. The misconception:\n\n* Judgments of deduction viewed as just an extreme judgment of probability \n  (where deduced judgments have probability 1).\n* All beliefs have an associated credence and full belief is merely a special \n  case when that value is 1.\n  * Example: \"all balls in the urn are black, draw a ball, that ball will be \n    black\" is just a special case with p=1 in \"fraction p of the balls in the \n    urn are black, draw a ball, it has probability p of being black\"\n  * The 10-coin toss example below will show why the former is not special \n    case of the latter, as the latter has a certain ambiguity.\n\n# Unambiguous statement \"10 coins are drawn, 5 of which are heads\"\n\n* If asked to compute the probability of it, we can do a calculation, but \n  we're implicitly assuming some extra structure because the question is \n  ambiguous.\n* You get a different answer if we are informed the 10 coin tosses arose in \n  the context of a different experiment: \"toss the coin repeatedly until you \n  get 5 heads in a row\".\n* Before we assumed the experiment was that the coin would be tossed 10 times \n  and then experiment would stop. This is just a different modal assumption, \n  but both interpretations are consistent with the factual statement in the \n  problem.\n* We can't asses probability of a proposition until we embed it in a modal \n  structure.\n* The content of probability judgments are not propositional contents, but \n  rather propositions embedded in some procedural context.\n* They are not the types of things we can arrive at by deduction.\n\n# Thus, probabilitic reasoning and deduction are distinct modes of inference.\n\n* Observing the coin is heads after the fact is no argument against the  \n  purportedly probabilistic nature of the coin toss.\n* The reason why it's not a good idea to bet against Laplace's Demon is not \n  because the world has only objectively only extremal probability, but \n  because the demon is not using probabilistic reasoning at all (he might as \n  well be looking at the coin after the fact - he doesn't have to assess \n  probabilities at all).\n  * Like playing poker against an opponent with x-ray vision should not make \n    us believe objective probability does not exist.\n\n# Upshots\n\n* Theoretical study of objective probabilities is back on the table.\n* relationship between inductive and deductive logic\n  * E.g. [Carnap](../people/Rudolf%20Carnap.md)'s inductive logics have a language with play a role of setting \n    up a procedural context in which it makes sense to ask for probabilities.\n  * Language does not take such a role in deductive contexts.\n    * E.g. a first order logic / deductive languages. If we make elementary \n      statements more specific, the deductive relations will not change, but \n      in an inductive language the probabilities may change dramatically.\n    * What sentences to pick as elementary or basic is more important in an \n      inductive language\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.360875959-08:00","tags":null},"/elucidations/6.-Experimental-philosophy":{"title":"6.

It's not \nalways meant to undermine traditional (armchair / mathematical) philosophy.\n\n## Free will example\n\n* Philosphers use \"our intuitions\" as evidence for a compatibilist view\n* Among all our externally determined actions, they need to identify a subset of \n  them as \"free\" - meaning things for which people can be credited / praised / \n  blamed for.\n* Our concept of \"freedom\" is compatible with our concept of \"externally caused\"\n* To demonstrate this, they use a thought experiment, but empirically we find \n  that the result of that experiment by varying trivial details - calls into \n  doubt whether the thought experiment was only convincing to a biased group of \n  people.\n* We tend to believe people can be held accountable when the stakes are higher \n  (the thought experiment example action is trivial =\u003e people conclude \n  determinism, the action is something heinous =\u003e people conclude compatibilism)\n\n# Why care?\n\nWhy do we care what laypeople think over professional philosophers? Are \nphilosophers biased away from the truth? Aren't we learning about what people \nsay rather than what really is?\n\n1. We're supplementing traditional philosophy - we want to show philosophical \n   conclusions are not at odds with reality (we at least need an account in \n   light of the evidence, e.g., above)\n1. Laypeople lack prior theoretical commitments to bias them.\n1. A general psychological investigation into how we draw conclusions from \n   evidence (what biases are at play when we go data -\u003e theory) is precisely \n   what philosophy has always done.\n   - We can learn how to do philosophy better by understanding, e.g., that we \n   are likely to draw certain conclusions given our human desire to punish.\n   - Some of our theories are an expression of current cultural identity \n   rather than universal truth\n\n# Moral consequences\n\n* This is in line with Nietzsche's geneology of morality, which leads to severe \n  relativism.

James' point was that carrying this exercise will not enlighten us about why truths are good to believe, or offer any clues as to why or whether our present view of the world is, roughly, the one we should hold. Yet nobody would have asked for a \"theory\" of truth if they had not wanted answers to these latter questions. Those who want truth to have an essence want knowledge, or rationality, inquiry, or the relation between thought and its object, to have an essence. Further, they want to be able to use their knowledge of such essences to criticize views they take to be false, and point the direction of progress toward the discovery of more truths. James' thinks these hopes are vain.\n\n— [Pragmatism, Relativism, and Irrationalism](../works/Pragmatism,%20Relativism,%20and%20Irrationalism.md)\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.319866129-08:00","tags":null},"/quotes/Rorty-on-neokantians":{"title":"Rorty on neokantians","content":"\n[Author](../people/Richard%20Rorty.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e In the nineteenth century, the notion of philosophy as a foundational discipline which \"grounds\" knowledge-claims was consolidated in the writings of the neo-Kantians\n\n— [Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature](../works/Philosophy%20and%20the%20Mirror%20of%20Nature.md),  Introduction\n","lastmodified":"2023-02-10T15:46:24.341765027-08:00","tags":null},"/quotes/Rortys-legacy":{"title":"","content":"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e In the end, Rorty’s adamant skepticism and anti-dogmatism are simply ways to be anti- authoritarian and irreverently anti-fetishistic.
