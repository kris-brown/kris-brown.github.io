[^1] Remember, the stimulus and response were supposed to be\nobjective features of the critters you were looking at. So that the behavioral\nscientist modeled on the natural scientist, her own conceptual scheme was not\nsupposed to be involved in characterizing the behavior of these critters.

Is that the behavior that has been\nassociated with the stimulus? Or would you predict that he'll go eight steps\nforward and press down on the bar.

Well, the minute you think\nabout this, you realize that we can gerrymander, what he was taught,\nthere are many descriptions, that that are available to us for what he was\ntaught.

Everything in Western philosophy is downstream of this \nmove, which brought philosophy into its modern age.\n\n* [Spinoza](../people/Baruch%20Spinoza.md) saw Descartes' philosophy as being understood in terms of his innovations of relating algebra to geometry. [^1]\n  * \"[The order and connection of things is the same as the order and connection of ideas](../quotes/Order%20and%20connection%20of%20ideas.md)\"\n  * The properties of what is representing or represented are irrelevant. \n    What's relevant is that there is a mapping between the relations in each \n    world.\n* If any things are known representationally, then some things must be known \n  *non*representationally (to avoid [infinite regress](../Representation%20regress.md))\n  * Representationalism gives rise to choice between [epistemological skepticism](../Epistemological%20skepticism.md) vs foundationalism.\n\nKant introduces the terminology of representation (Vorstellung) to the center of the philosophical stage.\n\n* A [Kantian](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md) insight: the *real* problem is [semantic skepticism](../Semantic%20skepticism.md).\n  * He doesn't take it for granted that we can 'represent' reality and merely have to worry about whether or not that representation is true.\n  * It might be unintelligible that our mental states even purport to specify how things are out there.\n  * This is a prior question to whether or not those purported claims are true.\n\n[^1]: Because Descrates was still holding onto some Scholastic beliefs, e.g. \"The idea of the sun is the sun itself existing in the intellect\", Spinoza talks better about how Descartes used representation than Descartes himself. \n\n## Rationalists vs empiricists\n\n* Kant says Descartes was right to think in terms of representation but that he \n  didn't distinguish two different kinds of representings: picture-like images/sensations vs sentence-like thoughts.\n  * He saw both as different ends of a spectrum, while empiricists tried to reduce thoughts to pictures and rationalists vice-versa.\n* Spinoza's interpretation of Descartes gives another view: within a representational picture, [empiricists](../Empiricism.md) are atomists whereas [rationalists](../Rationalism.md) are holists.\n* Brandom's interpretation using orders of explanation: empiricists treat representation as a primitive and infer reason-relations in terms of it. Rationalists treat reason relations as primitive, explain representational content in terms of inferential relations.\n  * Rationalist [Leibniz](../people/Gottfried%20Wilhelm%20Leibniz.md) would have us understand the content of the [map](../Maps.md) as the inferences that someone who treats it as a map could make about terrain facts (e.g. a river) from map-facts (wavy-blue line).\n* Sellars identifies both camps as [descriptivists](../Descriptivism.md) (to be conceptually contentful is just to describe / represent how things are).\n  * Empiricists start with narrow postulate about what representing is and exclude a lot of genuinely contentful thought due to not meeting this standard (e.g. ethics, modality).\n  * Rationalists take all our cognitively contentful expressions as therefore being part of the actual world, resulting in ontological extravagance (postulating objective values/universals/propositions/laws).\n  * Sellars saw the Tractatus as teaching us how to get beyond this ideology with the case of logical vocabulary ([quote](../quotes/Logic%20not%20representational.md)).\n  * Representation is a wider concept than description - Brandom thinks that Sellars' anti-descriptivism is a form of anti-representationalism.\n    * E.g. proper names represent without being descriptions, in [Naming and Necessity](../works/Naming%20and%20Necessity.md).\n\n## Lessons\n\n* Representation is a holistic conception, so rationalists were just right about that. (Kant's trancendental unity of apperception is a wholistic one; however, Hegel is the one who built this wholism into the ground floor of his philosophical idiom.)\n* Representation/description involve subjunctively-robust relations between representings and representeds.\n  * This is a dangerous thought if you are an empiricist: it means representation is not a purely descriptive notion.\n  * Considering Leibniz's example of the inferences of map facts to terrain facts, we also must accept that if the terrain were different, the map fact would be different.\n  * Related to [Fodor](../people/Jerry%20Fodor.md)'s account of representation in terms of \"one-way counterfactual dependencies of 'horses' on horses\".\n* The [normative character of representation](../Normative%20character%20of%20representation.md)\n  * To treat representation as concerning what inferences we can make is a normative order.\n  * Kant saw that the [Order and connection of ideas](../quotes/Order%20and%20connection%20of%20ideas.md) is a normative order. Relations between ideas are those of obligation, permission, and entitlement.\n\n# [Representationalism](../Representationalism.md)\n\n* [Declarativism](../Declarativism.md): a relatively defensible representationalist position\n* Dual to \"descriptivism\" which too narrowly construes representation as description (which is too constricted a notion of representation).\n* This too broadly understands what all declarative sentences do in terms of fact-stating / truth-aptness ('representation' becomes too expansive). Expressivism is one way of negating this (by declaring \"X is good\", one is commending rather than fact stating).\n  * Intuition: the question of truth can be raised for whatever is expressed by declarative sentences ([Geach's 1960 embedding argument](../The%20Frege-Geach%20problem.md)).\n  * Declarative sentences that may not fit into the fact-stating mold of \"the frog is on the log\":\n    * Logical (e.g. negative/conditional facts), modal (e.g. necessity), probabilistic, semantic (what expressions mean or represent), intentional \n      (possibly about non-existent objects like golden mountains / round squares), normative, abstract / mathematical.\n    * Are these all types of facts? Do they represent features of the world?\n\n# Antirepresentationalism\n\n## [Pragmatism](../Pragmatism.md)\n\nRorty characterizes pragmatism as fundamentally anti-representationalist  ([Cheryl Misak](../people/Cheryl%20Misak.md) strongly disagrees and considers Rorty to be a false heir of the tradition).\n\n* Representationalism is an *ideology* - that the meaningfulness of thoughts/talk \n  should be principally (or even exclusively) understood in terms of representational relations the thinkings/sayings stand in to what they (purport to) represent.\n  * During Enlightenment philosophy it infected epistemology, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language. This continues throughout modern philosophy.\n  * It's a crippling ideology that must be rejected wholesale, no hope of redemption.\n  * It's synonymous with modern [philosophy](../Philosophy.md), so that must be jettisoned too. This is \"philosophy with a capital P\". The kind of thing that Kant did. (Philosophy as queen of the sciences).\n\nRepresentationalism vs antirepresentationalism is reflected by the two sides of Wittgenstein:\n\n* [Tractatus](../works/Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus.md) = representationalism (but providing the model for moving beyond it w/r/t logical vocabulary)\n  \n  * Logical tradition from Frege/Russell, operative paradigm of formal \n    calculi for artificial symbolic languages.\n  * Possible world semantics best distillation of its representational \n    approach to meaning\n* [Philosophical Investigations](../works/Philosophical%20Investigations.md) = anti-representationalism.\n  - Anthropological tradition focuses on natural languages, in tradition of [Dewey](../people/John%20Dewey.md). Rorty claims [Heidegger](../people/Martin%20Heidegger.md) also in this tradition, which both sides (pragmatists and Heidegger allies)  don't like. Focus is not on meaning but on use.\n  \n  Rorty can retrospectively be seen as making three arguments over the course of his life:\n  \n  1. ([Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature](../works/Philosophy%20and%20the%20Mirror%20of%20Nature.md)) - representational in semantics leads to an unproductive oscillation in epistemology between skepticism and foundationalism\n  1.

One tactic \ninvolves denying the skeptic's implicit claim that these brain states are \ntantamount to experience.\n\nOne can grant there is a *causal* dependence between brain activity and \nexperience, but it is a leap to suggest that we can *identify* brain \nactivity with experience. \n\n### Argument 1: Empirical thought experiment\n\nThe two come apart in the following thought experiment:\n\nSuppose we found an incredible empirical correlation between brain \nactivity and experience, such that a brain scanner technology exists which can \ndetermine one's experience from a brain state measurement. \n\nNow suppose one day we suddenly had a conflict (the brain \nscanner says that the subject *thinks* he's drinking coffee, but we see \nhim eating ice cream and he assures us he thinks he is eating \nice cream). In such a case, we would conclude the brain scanner is wrong, not \nthe person. This demonstrates that, at least in cultures remotely similar to our \nown, conventional means of determining thoughts (e.g. first-person experiential \nreports, when subjects are not identified as hallucinating or having a reason \nto lie) have a *logically prior* status over any kind of scientific method.\n\n### Argument 2: Conceptual analysis\n\nWhat it *means* to be a thought is not the same thing as what it *means* to be a \nbrain state.\n\n* Brain states are connected by casual relationships. They, categorically, \n  cannot be 'correct' or 'incorrect', while thoughts can be.\n* Mental states occupy the *space of reasons* - the meaning of certain \n  thought is identified by its relationships to other thoughts. Structured \n  by normative relationships (can be correct or incorrect).\n* If a brain scanner with amazing correlation says that someone is telling a \n  lie by analyzing brain states, it may very well be that they are lying 100% of \n  the time that brain scanner says they're lying, but it is not the brain state \n  itself that makes them lying or not.\n\n## There are reasons to believe brains in vats cannot think\n\nDrawing from thoughts of [John MacDowell](../people/John%20MacDowell.md)'s [Mind and World](../works/Mind%20and%20World.md):\n\n* For a thought to be 'about' an object (world-directed, with empirical \n  content) - it's necessary that the correctness of the thought to be answerable \n  to how things are.\n* For an intention to be an intention - it has to determine the correctness / \n  incorrectness of some subsequent action.\n* A brain is not logically answerable to reality and is not overtly acting in \n  the world, so it's not fair to say it has thoughts or intentions.\n\n# Why even bother thinking about skeptic challenges?\n\n* [Stanley Cavell](../people/Stanley%20Cavell.md) has written well about  how skeptical lines of thought arise\n  naturally (i.e. they are not purely the product of academic philosophy).\n* Skepticism shows up in lots of fields/subfields of philosophy, and it's \n  important to prevent the confusion that arises here from spreading.

Calls himself the 'first psychologist'\n  * He is a 'speculative methodological naturalist' like Hume.\n  * Same kind of structure of argument that is characteristic of Hume:\n    * Take some class of beliefs (e.g. beliefs of morality)\n    * Be skeptical that the beliefs can be rationally arrived at\n    * Construct a psychological narrative for how we could have arrived at \n      those beliefs / why they are attractive to human beings as they are.\n    * E.g. in geneology of morals: how did the acetic ideal come to dominate \n      the human mind / major religions.\n\n# What is the argument?\n\n* How would Nietzsche try to convince someone who believes in morality (in the \n  pejorative sense)?\n  * Leitner believes Nietzsche's goal is not to get everyone to give up on \n    morality.\n    * \"Herd morality for the herd\"\n    * There are different types of people\n  * But there are (potential) creative geniuses like Goethe, Napoleon, \n    Nietzsche himself, etc., whose flourishing is hindered by morality.\n  * Lots of techniques to convince those people.\n  * Nietzsche acknowledges that belief isn't an entirely (or even mostly) \n    rational deliberative process, so his methods of convincing are unusual \n    compared to other philosophers.\n  * Writes to 'get you in the gut' - is crude/rude/joking/hyperbolic.\n  * \"We don't even notice the slave morality because it's been victorious\" He \n    knows his readership isn't even skeptical of morality, so he needs to be \n    provocative to loosen them up / open them up to critical reflection.\n  * Makes arguments\n    * E.g.

Stuff in between: marriage is important because it signals some sort of \n       societal approval of the act\n    * Nussbaum doubts that this is really as true as proponents claim:\n      * We don't think of the state as supporting the N'th marriage of some \n        celebrity\n      * Extremely low bar in most states for being able to officiate a \n        marriage\n  * Civil unions analogous to transracial marriage:\n    * People had to fight to not give this a different term since they truly \n      believe it is equal\n\n# Application to privacy\n\n* Three dimensions that get conflated:\n  * Informational: the private is secret\n  * Spatial: a private place, like the home\n  * Decisional: what is private is yours to design\n* Example: pornography is legal, but only in your home.

In general, there would be no non-extreme probabilities, \n    which is at odds with what makes probability theory useful.\n* Therefore, the desire to not step on determinism's toes historically has led \n  to a dominance of epistemic notions of probability.\n\n# Why not just submit to epistemic notion?\n\n* it would be remarkable if the ordinary claim that a coin toss is fair were \n  covertly a commentary on one's own ignorance.\n* analogy: whether or not we are justified in believing something depends on \n  our epistemic relation to the world. However, this doesn't mean that the \n  content of all our beliefs makes reference to our epistemic state.\n* But still, we then have to explain how to reconcile objective probability \n  with determinism.\n\n# Conflict between determinism and objective probability is an illusion due to a misconception about the content of judgments of probability. The misconception:\n\n* Judgments of deduction viewed as just an extreme judgment of probability \n  (where deduced judgments have probability 1).\n* All beliefs have an associated credence and full belief is merely a special \n  case when that value is 1.\n  * Example: \"all balls in the urn are black, draw a ball, that ball will be \n    black\" is just a special case with p=1 in \"fraction p of the balls in the \n    urn are black, draw a ball, it has probability p of being black\"\n  * The 10-coin toss example below will show why the former is not special \n    case of the latter, as the latter has a certain ambiguity.\n\n# Unambiguous statement \"10 coins are drawn, 5 of which are heads\"\n\n* If asked to compute the probability of it, we can do a calculation, but \n  we're implicitly assuming some extra structure because the question is \n  ambiguous.\n* You get a different answer if we are informed the 10 coin tosses arose in \n  the context of a different experiment: \"toss the coin repeatedly until you \n  get 5 heads in a row\".\n* Before we assumed the experiment was that the coin would be tossed 10 times \n  and then experiment would stop. This is just a different modal assumption, \n  but both interpretations are consistent with the factual statement in the \n  problem.\n* We can't asses probability of a proposition until we embed it in a modal \n  structure.\n* The content of probability judgments are not propositional contents, but \n  rather propositions embedded in some procedural context.\n* They are not the types of things we can arrive at by deduction.\n\n# Thus, probabilitic reasoning and deduction are distinct modes of inference.\n\n* Observing the coin is heads after the fact is no argument against the  \n  purportedly probabilistic nature of the coin toss.\n* The reason why it's not a good idea to bet against Laplace's Demon is not \n  because the world has only objectively only extremal probability, but \n  because the demon is not using probabilistic reasoning at all (he might as \n  well be looking at the coin after the fact - he doesn't have to assess \n  probabilities at all).\n  * Like playing poker against an opponent with x-ray vision should not make \n    us believe objective probability does not exist.\n\n# Upshots\n\n* Theoretical study of objective probabilities is back on the table.\n* relationship between inductive and deductive logic\n  * E.g.

If we make elementary \n      statements more specific, the deductive relations will not change, but \n      in an inductive language the probabilities may change dramatically.\n    * What sentences to pick as elementary or basic is more important in an \n      inductive language\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.238987958-05:00","tags":null},"/elucidations/5.-Perception":{"title":"5.

Some ways in which Sellars was remarkable:\n\n* Sellars had a systematic / synoptic vision, which was rare for \n  analytic philosophers (who largely preferred to write 'gem-like' articles). \n  * This makes it also hard to read Sellars - it's hard to get a hold of one piece \n    of it without getting the whole. \n* Sellars had an almost unique knowledge of and appreciation for the significance of the *history* of philosophy \n  * (not just a subdiscipline, but rather as the language in which philosophy is pursued).[^world]\n* Sellars' overall aim was to move analytic philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian phase.\n  * Epitomizes his views towards empiricism/naturalism (which had characterized \n    analytic philosophy). \n  * That Kant was worth respecting a radical view at the time - he had been \n    written out of the canon due to his connection to [Hegel](../people/Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel.md).[^1]\n  * Rawls on the theoretical side and Strawson/Bennett on the practical side \n    brough Kant back into respectability in Anglophone circles, but Sellars was \n    way out in front of this (and appreciated the significance of Kant deeper). \n  * This is also why Sellars wasn't so influential - people didn't understand \n    the Kant needed to appreciate him.\n\n## Kant's influence on Sellars\n\nKant's big idea:\n\nWhat is sapience? (what distinguishes *knowers* and mere responders to an environment?)\n\n* It's not some presence of \"mind-stuff\" (i.e. Cartesian dualism)\n* It's that judgments and intentional doings are things that knowers and agents \n  are in a distinctive sense *responsible for*.\n* Judgments express commitments of those subjects / their exercises of authority \n* The difference between mind minded things and unminded and things isn't an ontological one, but a *de*ontological one.\n\n*Judgment* is important for Kant \n\n* it is the minimal thing that we can \n  be held accountable for (the smallest unit of consciousness)\n* The form of the judgment has two parts:\n  * Subjective: the \"I think ...\" that can accompany any judgment \n    * *Who* is responsible\n  * Objective: \"object = x\" \n    * what you make yourself responsible *to* by taking the judgment\n    * what you need to consult in order to determine the correctness\n\nCartesian questions are about our grip on concepts. Thinking about concepts as \nrules for making judgments, Kantian questions are about the concepts' grip on us.\n\n* A concept is the rule you bind yourself to by calling the coin 'copper'. (You \n  commit yourself, whether you know it or not, to it's being an electrical\n  conductor, melting at a particular temperature, etc.).\n\n* Rather than a Cartesian mind-body problem, it's a norm-fact problem. The relationship \n  between prescription and description - that's what is special about *us*.\n\nHegel took this Kantian question and observed that normative status are \nsocially instituted statuses - we have to look at social practices to understand \nwhat responsibility / authority are. (this idea was reintroduced indepenently \nby the later Wittgenstein - for example his [children's game](../A%20children's%20game.md) investigates the \nnormative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions).\n\nSellars on what is philosophy: \"the attempt to say how things, in the largest \nsense of that term, hang together, in the largest sense of that term.\" \n\n[^world]: This is one dimension along which the world spirit has caught up with \nSellars.\n\n# Core programs of analytical philosophy\n\nAnalytic philosophy held together as being a *semantic* project. \n\n* Understand the meanings of potentially-problematic target vocabularies in \n  terms of the meanings of putatively-unproblematic base vocabularies. \n  * Some debate over what the relation between target and base vocabularies \n    needs to be:\n    * definability\n    * translatability\n    * paraphrasability\n    * \"analyzable in terms of\"\n    * reducibility\n    * supervenience\n* Examples:\n  * *On denoting*: problematic vocabulary is definite descriptions, translated \n    into the unproblematic vocabulary of FOL with identity.\n  * Frege's problematic vocabulary was arithmatic statements, which were made \n    sense of in quantificational logic with identity.\n* Things like intentional, normative, metaphysical vocabularies were typically \n  problematic.\n  * Core programs of empiricism and naturalism can be understood as having \n    different choice of base vocabularies\n    * Empiricism: base language is sensory experience (e.g. a language of sense \n      data, language of how things seem or appear)\n    * Naturalism: language of natural science (possibly just fundamental \n      physics or broader)\n    * The Vienna Circle was divided into two wings. Schlict (empiricist) and Neurath \n      (naturalist), and Carnap in between. Prime source of tension between them was \n      modality / lawlikeness. \n  * *Functionalism*: Unproblematic vocabulary is talking about how something \n    plays a role in a larger system. (paradigmatically shows up in the \n    philosophy of mind.)\n    * Sellars was the first functionalist. broader than the sense that it \n      comes up in the philosophy of mind: Sellars is a *semantic* functionalist.\n\nAnother reason why Sellars is important is his distinctive views about \nempiricism, naturalism, and functionalism.\n\n## Role of logic\n\nLogic as developed in the early 20th century is a powerful tool for giving us \ninferential control. Logical empiricists found this tool indispensible. \nThey viewed the early empiricists (e.g. Locke, Hume) as \nhaving the right building blocks, but \"association\" was too weak of a mortar to \nhold them together and build the edifice of knowledge of the objective world.\nAlthough Sellars isn't a logical empiricist, he also found logic to be a useful\ntool and can be thought of as a logical Kantian. After Kant, the nextmost \nimportant philosopher for Sellars was Carnap. (despite Carnap's empiricism.)\n\n# Summary of views\n\nIt is debated whether or not Sellars was an reductive naturalist, but Brandom does not \nthink so.\n\n[Author](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e In characterizing an episode or a state as *knowing*, we are not giving an\n \u003e empirical description of it. We are placing it in the logical space of reasons, \n \u003e of justifying and being able to justify what one says. \n\n— [Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind](../works/Empiricism%20and%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind.md) §36\n\n* Note, there's nothing too special about *knowing*.\n  * He could also have said *believing*.\n* We're *doing* something, an act that's not *describing* something.\n* Relates to the [Scienta mensura](../quotes/Scienta%20mensura.md) quote - we have an example of something \n  (describing knowledge) as something that science is not the measure of all \n  things about.\n\n* This is a powerful weapon against empiricist reductionisms of all sorts, \n  according to Brandom.\n\nThere is a Cartesian dualism threatening the tradition that Kant is overcoming.\nIs Sellars replacing this with a norm-fact dualism? \n\nWhat is a dualism? What a distinction becomes when it is drawn in such terms \nthat the relation between the distinguished terms becomes unintelligible. \nComplaint about Cartesian dualism:\n\n* if you're committed to \"mind stuff\" being non-extended.\n* and to the physical world being extended.\n* throw in some general claims about causation (e.g. it occurs in a place)\n* then perception and agency become unintelligble (how is the mind affected by real stuff / how can the mind cause something?)\n\nFor norm fact distinction. \n\n* Epistemological questions: \n  * How can we know about norm stuff? in the way we know about mass? \n  * Does it causally affect us? \n* Ontological questions: \n  * Where in the world of natural science do we find these things?\n\nA reductive naturalist doesn't have to face this threat of a dualism. But one \nloses the meaning.\n\n## A Kantian idea that sellars never lost sight of: the transcendental move\n\nThe conceptual framework that makes it possible to give matter-of-factual \ndescriptions of how things actually are - that framework has essential features \nwhich can also be put into words - but those words will not be playing the role \nof describing things how they are. For example: alethic modal vocabulary.\n\nTo *describe* things you have to commit yourself to inferential relations that are \ncounterfactually robust (otherwise you're merely labeling).\n\nHume thought he could understand what means for the cat to be on the mat but not \nthat it is impossible for the cat to be weightless or as big as the sun. Sellars \nsays that, unless you make *some* distinction about what is possible/necessary for cats \nand what is not (note you don't have to get it *right*), you can't count as \napplying the  concept *cat* to describe something. So you can't be in the \npredicament Hume thought he was in. The argument is seen in \n[Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities](../works/Counterfactuals,%20Dispositions,%20and%20the%20Causal%20Modalities.md).\n\nA 'master idea' that Sellars never explicitly says at this level of generality:\n\nevery philosophically interesting/problematic vocabulary turns out metalinguistic:\n\n* logical vocabulary:\n  * \"if ... then ...\" does not describe something in the world but makes explicit inferential commitments that articulate the contents of concepts that do (in the narrow sense) describe thing\n* alethetic modal vocabulary \n  * Makes what you are doing with subjunctives explicit\n* normative vocabulray\n* semantic vocabulary\n  * because it's true of normative and modal vocabulary\n* intentional vocabulary\n  * because it's true of semantic vocabulary\n* ontological vocabulary\n  * e.g. universals\n\nHis strategy for dealing with problematic vocabulary is to treat as metalinguistic.\n\nHis notion of metalinguistic isn't made explicit anywhere. It's more flexible \nthan for Carnap. One attempt at explaining it: what metalinguistic discourses \ndo is functionally classify bits of vocabulary. He thinks of it as transcendental\ngrammar.\n\nPragmatic dependencies make explicit conceptual dependencies. \n\n* E.g. \"Looks $\\phi$\" talk depends on \"Is $\\phi$\" talk. ([EPM](../works/Empiricism%20and%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind.md))\n\n## Cautionary tale about saying things aren't descriptive\n\nFirst-wave metaethical expressivists said that the role ethical vocabulary played was not \nto *describe* but rather to express attitudes (e.g. approval, disapproval). But \nGeach showed that there exist *some* descriptive content due to the intelligibility \nof \"If he ought to do X, then he has reason to do X\" (one is not expressing \napproval of doing X).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nKant is a empirical realist, transcendental idealist. Sellars is an empirical \nnaturalist, but a trancendental non-naturalist. This gives Sellars his unique \nperspective on the problems of philosophy.\n\n* the empricial naturalism is epitomized by [Scienta mensura](../quotes/Scienta%20mensura.md) quote\n* the transcendental non-naturalism comes from the ineliminble expressive role \n  that is played by metalinguistic expressions \n  * There is no prospect of getting rid of that in our discourse\n  * Yet it is also not in the jurisdiction of science.\n\nDespite Sellars is concerned with transposing things into a linguistic key \nand sees the significance of conceptual change, he is still a Kantian rather than \na Hegelian. \n\n* He wants to figure out what was happening around the time of Newton and Locke.\n* He does not see that there's one phenomenon of which the scientific revolution is one manifestation. And the French Revolution is another. \n  * Hegel saw that there was such a thing as modernity\n  * Brandom says you don't get to count as a Hegelian unless you're concerned \n    with that whole thing, rather than just the scientific revolution.\n\n# Personal note\n\nWhen Brandom joined the department in '76, Sellars was a bitter, grumpy old man, aged 65.\nThis surprised Brandom in his youthful innocence (how could you be unhappy when\nyou've been so philosophically accomplished? just think about your accomplishments!).\n\n1. It's taken until Kant's death until now for anybody (i.e. Sellars) to figure out  \n   what he was on about. He thought he'd get the same fate.\n1. He felt he'd been treated badly by the profession.\n\n* He hadn't written anything until he was age 35.\n* In 1956 he had three lectures in London which were a stunning success.\n* In 1960, more dissertations were written on Sellars than any other living \n  philosopher.\n* But that was the same year *Word and Object* came out. It was a tidal wave.\n* Only thing that interrupted that wave, if anything, in the next decade was \n  *Naming and Necessity*.\n* Sellars' Locke lectures in 1963 were utterly disasterous. Sellars never \n  recovered from this. On his deathbed he said it was the worst experience of \n  his life.\n* He had the view, admirable but disasterous, to only deliver unfinished work \n  at seminars (let's work out these ideas together, I don't want to tell you \n  something that I have no chance of changing my mind about - that's what \n  written publishing is for).\n* At age 45 he was finally getting the respect he deserved and 9 years later \n  it was all over.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.396301837-05:00","tags":null},"/sellars2009/02-Inference-and-Meaning-and-Language-Games-2009":{"title":"02 - Inference and Meaning and Language Games (2009)","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](01%20-%20Historical%20context%20and%20quotes%20%282009%29.md) [Next](03%20-%20Language%20as%20thought%20and%20different%20species%20of%20ought%20%282009%29.md)\n\n# Note on Sellars' style\n\n* He preferered the 'Mystery story' style:\n  * There's a problem, and many competing potential explanations\n  * These explanations engage each other dialectically\n  * Only at the end would you learn the philosopher's actual position\n* In contrast to the 'Journalistic' style:\n  * Tell them what you're going to tell them\n  * Tell them\n  * Tell them what you told them\n\n# [Material inferences](../Material%20inference%20vs%20logical%20inference.md)\n\nLet an *inference* be a statement with a [material conditional](../Material%20Conditional.md), i.e. of the \nform \"If $P$, then $Q$\"[^1] in a language with ordinary statements as well as \nlogical connectives (e.g.  *and*, *or*).

This could be generalized to \ngive us a notion of other types of vocabularies. E.g. we identify *theological* \nvocabulary (e.g. *God*, *pious*) and observe which good inferences (e.g. \n\"*If God loves* fishing, *then* fishing *is pious*\") cannot \nbe made into bad inferences by substituting non-theological vocabulary, i.e. \nsentences which are true purely due to their theological form.\n\n## Sellars has two good ideas associated with material inference:\n\n1. There *are* some inferences that are good, not in virtue of their logical form.\n1. Turn the above thought on its head and say: we can understand the content of \n   these descriptive terms in terms of the materially good inferences they\n   appear in (as premises or conclusions).\n\nBy this account, material proprieties of inference are more fundamental than / \nconceptually prior to logical validity. You have to start with the notion of a \ngood inference in order to understand what a logically good inference is.\n\n# Aside on the philosophy of logic\n\nAside: It took a while in the 20th century to realize that logic was not about\nlogical truth but rather about validity of inference. In classical logic can\nyou treat these interchangably, but not all (rough logics vs smooth logics -\nwhether the consequence relation can be determined by the set of all theorems).\n[Dummett](../people/Michael%20Dummett.md) has written about this issue.\n\nWhat if we picked some other vocabulary (other than logical) to hold fixed? E.g.\nsubstituting non-theological vocabulary for non-theological vocabulary.\n\"If justice is loved by the gods then justice is pious\". If no matter what we\nsubstitute for justice the inference is good, we might say the sentence is true\nin virtue of its theological form.\n\nPhilosophy of logic (See Quine's and Putnam's books both titled *The Philosophy\nof Logic*) has two classic questions:\n\n1. a *demarcation* question: what makes something logical vocabulary?\n   * Quine disallows second order quantifiers and the epilson of set\n     theory, whereas Putnam allows them.\n1. a *correctness* question: which logical consequence relation to use:\n   * Classical? Intuitionistic? etc.\n\nSellars challenges this tradition (logical empiricism) by pointing out there is\na concern conceptually prior in the order of explanation to philosophy of\nlogic: materially good inferences.\n\n# Inference and Meaning\n\n* A main argument of *Inference and Meaning* is that any language that makes \n  essential use of non-logical, descriptive vocabulary must be understood as \n  having that vocabulary standing in materially good (rather than just logically \n  good) inferences.\n\n* A slogan for this: \"Concepts as involving laws (and inconceivable without them)\"\n  \n  * This is actually the title of an unintelligible essay by Sellars\n  * Luckily the title is the thesis, and that much is intelligible\n* Sellars claims logical vocabulary has the expressive job of making explicit the \n  material proprieties of inference that articulate the content of non-logical \n  concepts.\n\n* More specifically than 'logical', he means *alethic modal* vocabulary: i.e. \n  what's *necessary* and what's *possible*.\n\n* Historical note: Frege is more explicit about this point than Sellars: that \n  you can use this to distinguish logical vocabulary.\n\n* The [Montaigne example](../Montaigne's%20dog.md) highlights \n  the difference between the capacity to use material inferences vs making that \n  inference explicit:\n  \n  * Dan Dennett argues that we have to take animals as grasping modus ponens \n    because they treat some inferences as good and others as bad\n  * Sellars objects, saying that you *could* make explicit the practical \n    capacity the animal has via a statement of disjunctive syllogism\n  * But what is the surplus value of invoking that explicit expression? (Over \n    simply describing what is the dog can do).\n* Talking about following rules very quickly gets into the [regress of rules](../Regress%20of%20rules.md).\n  \n  * There have to be some practical moves you're just allowed to make without \n    them having to take the form of explicit premises (see \n    [What the Tortoise said to Achilles](../works/What%20the%20Tortoise%20said%20to%20Achilles.md).\n  * Sellars touches upon this in [Some reflections on language games](../works/Some%20reflections%20on%20language%20games.md).\n    * He talks about free/auxillary positions that you're always allowed to \n      occupy.\n    * We could have the auxillary position $\\forall x, \\psi(x)\\vdash \\phi(x)$ \n      which would license us to move from a position $\\psi(a)$ to a position \n      $\\phi(a)$, but we could also encode this with position for each possible\n      move ($\\psi(a)\\vdash \\phi(a)$, $\\psi(b)\\vdash\\phi(b)$, ...).\n    * He ways that we could imagine replacing positions with moves, but it's \n      not possible to imagine all moves being replaced with positions ('a \n      game without moves is Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark').\n* Sellars is addressing tradition that wants some small set of explicit \n  principles in accordance with which to reason. Any inference you think is good \n  that isn't derivable from that small set of principles (e.g. modus ponens) is \n  actually an infamy (has some suppressed premises). This is early analytic \n  philosophy's embrace of the new logic. Sellar's contrary view (radical at the \n  time) is that actually the reasoning could be completely in order, just with \n  material proprieties of reasoning. You can still give/ask for reasons and mean \n  that $p$, but what the logic does is give you meta-linguistic control to talk \n  about what is a good inference and say that $p \\vdash q$ is a good \n  inference.[^1]\n\n* Example: $A\\vdash B$ where $A$ is \"she asked me to hand her the dish towel\" \n  and $B$ is \"I shall hand her the dish towel\". Traditional analytic philosophy \n  will call this an infamy, since it does not explicitly state how her request \n  engages my motivational structure. Sellars would want to say that this \n  invocation of the desire makes explicit the endorsement of $A \\vdash B$ rather \n  than referring to some item of the world.\n\n* Brandom: logic is the organ of semantic self-consciousness. The set of \n  concepts that lets us bring our endorsement of some inferences as good/bad \n  (this endorsement as something that reasons can be given or asked for) into \n  the game of giving/asking for reasons.\n\n* Sellars complains about Carnap treating logical consequence as a syntactically \n  definable relation between sentences. Just writing down the rules under a \n  heading 'rules' instead of 'axioms' isn't making explicit the normative force \n  they have (it leaves out the rulishness - that a rule is a rule for *doing* \n  something). This is a subtle point that doesn't matter for many purposes, but \n  Sellars believes it's important if you want to understand what's going on with \n  reasoning. Again, strong connection between this point and *Achilles and the \n  Tortoise*.\n\n* \"There's an important difference between logical / modal / normative \n  predicates on the one hand, and such predicates as 'red' on the other.\" \n  There's nothing to the formal except their role in reasoning, indeed, their \n  role and make as meta linguistics sort of making explicit something about the \n  ground level. For the latter, he wants to argue that these predicates too are \n  meaningful insofar as their role in reasoning, but it's less obvious.\n\n* \"Red is a quality\". This conveys the same information as the syntactical \n  sentence \"*Red* is a one place predicate.\" See \n  [quote](../quotes/Transposed%20language%20of%20norms.md). What you're *doing* in asserting \n  that premise from which to reason (couched in modal vocabulary) is endorsing a \n  principle in accordance with which to reason (couched in normative vocabulary).\n\n* We cannot completely identify modal and normative statements with each other. \n  Their relation is characterized by the say/convey distinction.\n\n[^1]: However, Sellars doesn't extrapolate from this that logic is an *optional* \nsuperstructure in our lives - we need to be able to think and talk about the \ngoodness of inferences.\n\n## Say/convey distinction\n\nWhen I say \"copper melts at 1084 degrees\" one makes a claim that is true even if \nthere were no reasoners (so it can't be a claim directly *about* inferences \nbeing good). What it *conveys* is about inferences, not what it *says*. \nLikewise, I say \"The sun is shining\" while I convey \"I believe the sun is \nshining.\"\n\nIt might help to make progress toward understanding the say/convey distinction \n(which Sellars admits he's not clear about) by distinguishing two flavors of \ninference:\n\n1. semantic inference: good in virtue of the contents of the premises and the \n   conclusion\n1. pragmatic inference: good in virtue of what you're doing in asserting the \n   premises or the conclusion.\n   * e.g. John says 'your book is terrible' and I infer that he's mad at me\n   * Geech embedding distinction between the two: we look at whether we'd \n     endorse \"My book is terrible, then John is mad at me\". Because we \n     wouldn't, we know the inference is pragmatic.\n\n## Do subjunctive conditionals describe possible worlds?\n\nPotential counterargument against Sellars: subjunctive conditionals are not \nmaking explicit proprieties of inference, but in fact are descriptions about \npossible worlds. To address this, we note there are separate issues.\n\nFirstly, there's the question about whether it's intelligible to have \ndescriptive vocabulary in play in a context where there's no counterfactual \nreasoning. E.g. Hume believes he understands empirical facts perfectly well (the \ncat is on the mat) but not statements about what's possible and necessary. But \nKant saw that this isn't intelligible - you need to make a distinction about \nwhat's possible with the cat and what's not (it's possible for the cat to not be \non the mat, but not possible for it to be larger than the sun) or else there's \nnothing you could say about the content of the concept of 'cat' that I've got (\nit would be just a label).\n\nThe second issue is the codifiability of proprieties of material inference by \nlogical vocabulary: whether a possible worlds analysis is incompatible with \nseeing subjunctive conditionals as making properties of inference explicit. \nSellars would like to see a possible worlds analysis that matches up.\n\n# Some Reflections on Language Games\n\nRegulism (conceptual norms as a matter of explicit rules) vs regularism (norms \nin terms of actual regularities). These are identified with empiricist and \nrationalist approaches. \n\nOne purpose: \"I shall have a chief my present purpose if I've made plausible the \nidea that an organism might come to play a language game, that is to move from \nposition to position, the system of moves and positions, and to do it because of \nthe system without having to obey rules, and hence without having to be playing \na meta language game.'' (Section 18)\n\nHe doesn't explicitly mention Wittgenstein (who is a pariah in philosophy). \n(Other times he uses astrices to censor his name). Thinking about language in \nterms of rules is Kantian. His notion of norms was juridical/jurisprudential. A \nrule that enjoins the doing of an action A is a sentence in some language, which \nrequires more rules to interpret (regress - how do we deal with it?). Kant \nidentified this regress (A132/B171) - \"judgment is a peculiar talent that can be \npracticed only and not taught''. Which is using distinction between things that \ncan be shown (by examples) vs taught. Wittgenstein addresses this regress in the \nlate 100's of PI.\n\nRejecting mere conformity: If we just consider conforming to a rule rather than \nobeying a rule, there's no regress, but we lose the normativity.\n\n\"\\[Mere conformity people\\] claim that it's raining therefore the streets will be \nwet (when it isn't an infamatic abridgement of a formally valid argument) is \nmerely the manifestation of a tendency to expect to see the wet streets when one \nfinds it's raining. In this latter case, it's a manifestation of a process which \nat best can only simulate inference, since it's a habitual transition, and as \nsuch not governed by a principle or rule by reference to which can be \ncharacterized as valid or invalid. That Hume dignified the activation of an \nassociation with the phrase 'causal inference' is about a minor flaw, they \ncontinue, in an otherwise brilliant analysis. It should, however, be immediately \npointed out that before one has a right to say that what Hume calls 'causal \ninference' really is an inference at all, but merely a habitual transition from \none thought to another. And contrast that with in this context, the genuine \nlogical inferences which are, one must pay the price of showing just how logical \ninference is something more than a mere habitual transition empiricists in the \nhuman tradition have rarely paid this price, a fact which is proved most \nunfortunate for the following reason. An examination of the history of the \nsubject shows that those who have held that causal inference only simulates \ninference proper have been led to do so as a result of the conviction that if \nit were a genuine inference, the laws of nature, things that govern this would \nbe discovered to us by pure reason.  As they're thinking of what's a good \ninference having to be something that's transparent merely by introspection in \nthe way that the laws of logic are.'' (him making point about distinction of r\neal inferences and mere associations. )\n\nNo distinction between correct and incorrect can be made by purely pointing to \nregularity - as Wittgenstein pointed out, you'll always find some regularity \n(there's some elegant rule that generates the sequence, for any arbitrary \nsequence). This is also called '[disjunctivitis](../Disjunctivitis.md)' or 'gerrymandering' objections.\n\n\"what's denied is the playing a game logically involves obedience to the rules \nof the game. And hence the ability to use the language to play the language game \nin which the rules are formulated.'' (page 29) Need a sense of playing the game \nstronger than conforming but weaker than having the rules in mind.\n\nMetaphysicus suggests why not a non-linguistic awareness of the rules? This is \nits own regress.\n\n \u003e \n \u003e We've tacitly accepted so far and the dialectic dichotomy between merely \n \u003e conforming to the rules and obey. But surely this is a false dichotomy. Is there \n \u003e something in between, for it required us to suppose that the only way in which a \n \u003e complex system of activity can be involved in the explanation of the occurrence \n \u003e of a particular act is by the agent explicitly envisaging the system and \n \u003e intending its realization. And that's as much as to say that unless the agent \n \u003e conceives of the system, the conformity of his behavior to the system must be \n \u003e accidental.\n\n* So what's needed he's saying, is going to be something that says, look, \n  there's an explanation of why he conforms to the rules. That invokes the \n  rules, but it doesn't invoke them by him being aware of them. One example of \n  this is teleosemantics. See [Bee Waggle](../Bee%20Waggle.md).\n\nThe essential thing for Kant was a distinction between what was between acting \naccording to a rule and acting according to a conception of a rule, or a \nrepresentation (Vorstellung) of a rule. So, ordinary natural objects act \naccording to rules, the laws of nature, but we act according to representations \nof rules / to conceptions of rules.\n\nThe explanation as to why I use the word 'purple' for purple things, the rule \nplays a crucial part even if it is not in my head. It is in the teachers' heads \n(they're already in the language and can conceive of rules). So the rule is \ncausally antecedent to my behavior, so I can be following the rule (without \nregress).\n\nRelated quesiton addressed here: [classical behaviorism](../Behaviorism.md).\n\nHow is it that I can apply a concept according to norms, to invoke a \npre-linguistic awareness of universals, that's going to be a given. And the key \nthing is, because that pre-linguistic awareness is conceived of as providing \n*reasons* for me to do this. It's not just that I've been *trained* to respond \nto some physiological thing by doing it (that would be okay. That could be part \nof the the real explanation, the pattern governed explanation). It's that that \npre-linguistic awareness provides reasons. And the claim is reasons are always \nmaking a move in a game that's making the inferential move. And the question is: \nwhat determines the norms that govern that? Then we're off on the on the regress, \nagain, so we've got to have some story that doesn't have that form. The form of \nthe argument against the myth of the given. It's the idea that the awareness \nthat givenness provides something that can serve as a reason, but is itself not \ndependent on our having learned a language, having a conceptual scheme, and so \non.\n\nTo do: understand language entry transitions and language exit transitions.\n\nThere is debate (but it should be more of a bigger deal, in Brandom's opinion) \nabout what are the minimal features needed for one to have a discursive language \npractice. Brandom views logical language as optional (though the expressive \npower would be incredibly stunted, you could still give and ask for reasons).\nMacDowell and Sellars think otherwise, that there can't be discourse without a \nmeta-language.\n\nSellars needs the notion of language to be something that evolves over time \n(rather than an instantaneous collection of rules) because we want the decision \nto make a material move to occur within a language (one is not doing \nredescription in another language).\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.391379684-05:00","tags":null},"/sellars2009/03-Language-as-thought-and-different-species-of-ought-2009":{"title":"03 - Language as thought and different species of ought (2009)","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](02%20-%20Inference%20and%20Meaning%20and%20Language%20Games%20%282009%29.md) [Next](04%20-%20Counterfactuals%20and%20the%20Kant-Sellars%20Thesis%20%282009%29.md)\n\n# Language as thought and communication\n\nSellars wants to give us a naturalistic account of intentionality.\n\nLogical behaviorism / philosophical behaviorism\n\nDef: the view that one can analyze without remainder intentional vocabulary / \nintentional concepts into purely behavior characterizations / dispositions to \npublicly observable behavior (specified in a non-intentional vocabulary).\n\nIntroduced in [Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind](../works/Empiricism%20and%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Mind.md) (9 years earlier), distinct \nfrom what he here calls logical behaviorism. *Logical behaviorism* refers to a \nview he attributes to Ryle. JB Watson and BF Skinner promoted this in psychology. \nSellars never endorsed this because he saw this as being an application of \n[instrumentalism](../Instrumentalism.md) in the philosophy of science.\n\nObservable things, at least we know they exist. Theoretical things, we've got to \nmake risky inferences to get to them. But we can also make observational \nmistakes. Not just \"I thought it was a fox but it was a dog\", but categorical \nobservational mistakes. We can give some concept an observational role (e.g. \ndeclare that we can observe X's) yet no X's exist, i.e. no thing has such no \nthing with such circumstances of application and consequences of application. \nE.g. [sour acid](../Sour%20acid.md) and \n[referring to witches](../Referring%20to%20witches.md) examples.\n\n*The Plasticity of Mind* is about bad theories incorporating observational \npractices, i.e. \"What do you mean there are no K's. I can *see* K's, there's one \nright there!\"\n\nSo again, this is a response to someone saying we can distinguish theoretical \nfrom observable entities by pointing to the fact that we can make mistakes about \nwhole categories of theoretical entities. Furthermore, \n[Pluto](../Pluto.md) is a great counterexample for this \ndistinction.\n\nJust because our evidence for attributing mental states comes from behavior does \nnot mean, unless you are an instrumentalist, that you have to be able to define \nintentional concepts in terms of behavior. (This doesn't mean that the intentional \nstates are less real, just that we aren't in a position to observe anything but \nthe behavior)\n\n## Digressions\n\n1. [Semantics](../Semantics.md) is a field with instrumentalist vs theoretical realist views. \n   [Michael Dummett](../people/Michael%20Dummett.md) is an instrumentalist \n   by observing the fact that meaning something \n   is only understood through verbal behavior and concluding that any theory of \n   meaning must be definable in terms of behavior.\n   \n   * (A theoretical realist might postulate meanings as theoretical entities to \n     explain verbal behavior and say our access to meanings is inferential and, \n     if they are good theories, then verbal behavior gives us inferential \n     access to something (meanings) that exist.)\n1. [MacDowell](../people/John%20MacDowell.md) and Sellars agree \n   (and disagree with almost all others) that what \n   you hear when someone talks to you is the words themselves, rather than \n   hearing noises and (by some inferential process) constructing the words. \n   You have to actually actively do some work to hear that mere noises. This is \n   evidenced by how difficult it was to tell computers how to recognize a smile \n   in a picture.\n   \n   * (Some say it's a contradiction to say that meanings are essentially \n     normative yet, on the other hand, we sometimes can directly perceive them. \n     But there's nothing in principle unobservable about normative states of \n     affairs - see Sellars' criteria of observation below)\n\n(Controversial) Criteria for observation:\n\n1. You have the capacity to reliably and differentially respond to some \n   normative state of affairs\n1. You have to have the concept and which is a matter of inferential \n   articulation and practical mastery of inferential proprieties, involving it. \n   And then if you can hook the one up to the other, you've turned what was \n   beforehand a theoretical concept for you into into the concept of an \n   observable/\n\nSellars wants to make sense of the notion of \"language as a rule-governed \nenterprise\" (as essentially involving norms). Sellars believes that if your \naccount language doesn't involve norms, you will be describing the vehicles by \nwhich we communicate, rather than what we're saying/meaning.\n\nReminder that, due to the [regress argument](../Regress%20of%20rules.md), \nthat we need to broaden our notion of 'rule' from just explicit rules and need \nthink of rules also as implicit in what we do. Sellars wants to better \nunderstand the relationship between implicit practical abilities and explicit\nrepresentations of rules.\n\nThe question of whether meaning is a normative concept was brought to \nphilosophical attention by [Kripkenstein](../works/Wittgenstein%20on%20Rules%20and%20Private%20Language.md). In present literature, Hattiangadi and Katherin Glüer have pushed back upon the idea that it is a normative concept, advanced by Brandom and MacDowell. Brandom feels it is because they haven't learned lessons from Sellars, in particular thinking of norms purely in terms of explicit presecriptions and not making the distinction \nbetween ought-to-be's and ought-to-do's.\n\n \u003e \n \u003e You can define *possibility* in terms of *not* and *necessity*. You can define \n \u003e *necessity* in terms of *not* and *possibility*. I think it's the beginning of \n \u003e wisdom to think of defining *not* in terms of the relationship between \n \u003e *possibility* and *necessity*, but I'm the only human being who thinks that.\n\n[Grice](../people/Paul%20Grice.md) on non-natural meaning: reduces what \na linguistic expression $P$ means in \nterms of the meanings of thoughts and beliefs of those uttering $P$. Sellars \nisn't satisfied with this: the puzzling phenomena of meaning are common to both \nthought and language.\n\nSellars says \"ought-to-be's imply ought-to-do's\" but is not exact about what \nquantifier: all or some? Brandom thinks 'some' makes more sense, since there \ncould be an ought-to-be requiring a state of affairs to change without telling \nus who has to do what to fix it (you need auxillary hypotheses to turn it into \nan ought-to-do). E.g. \"all clocks should be in sync\".\n\nWith a trainer, someone with concepts/rules can condition language learners to \nshape their behavior (teach them ought-to-be's). It's important that it's \npossible for the language enterprise get off the ground (i.e. without trainers). \nIt's possible for some sort of selection process to naturally reinforce\nought-to-be's (can be social but the conditioners need not be doing so intentionally).\n\nWe can deliberate making a distinction between ought-to-be's in the context of \nhumans vs nonliving/nonsentient beings (e.g. \"plants ought to get enough water\").\n\\[\\[Ruth Millikan\\]'\\]s work relevant. \nConnects to the [Aristotelian](../people/Aristotle.md) account.\n\nConsider ought to be's in the context of training animals: These rats ought to \nbe in state $\\phi$ whenever $\\psi$.\n\n* Could be just for rats, qua rats\n* they ought to be eating when they're hungry, or something like that\n* this could be something we want the rats to do\n  * when they come to a branch in a maze, the rats go to the side that's painted \n    blue and not to the side that's painted red.\n  * That's a regularity that ought to be not because we can read it off of the \n    fundamental teleology of rats\n  * The conformity of the rats in question to this rule does *not* require that \n    they have a *concept* $C$, e.g. of colors blue and red. We just require them \n    to respond properly certain to differences emanating from $C$. This doesn't \n    require even consciousness (photocells can respond differentially to colors).\n\n\"Recognitional capacity\" gets systematically used in two fundamentally different \nsenses (an 'accordion word')\n\n* reliable, differential response\n* applying a concept\n\nImportant for Sellars that following an ought-to-be requires only the former \nsense.\n\nWe should talk about learning a language as 'coming into the language' rather \nthan 'learning a language'. It's more like the way one comes into a city. You \ncome to be able to take part in an ongoing practice, as opposed to getting some \nintellectual insight.\n\nTeaching the very young child to say 'purple' when showing her a purple lolipop \nis getting her to follow an ought-to-be just like the rat example. There is an \nought-to-do for teachers of a language that they see to it that children produce \nthe appropriate responses. This presupposes that the teachers do have a \nconceptual framework of 'purple' and of 'vocalize' and what it is for an action \nto be called by a circumstance. The learner is not required to have any of these \nconcepts. The ought-to-be is explicit in the teacher's mind.\n\n# [Instrumentalism](../Instrumentalism.md)\n\nAll of our evidence in science comes from empirical observation, so all of our \nconcepts (and claims) must be translatable without remainder into observational \nvocabulary.\n\nWhat warrant would there be for any conceptual excess beyond the language of our \nevidence?\n\nThere aren't really any theoretical entities. We postulate them merely to \ncharacterize regularities of observable entities. Statements in the \nobservational language are simply true or false, whereas statements in \ntheoretical language are merely more or less useful.\n\nThis is a view that members of the Vienna Circle flirted with. A permanent \ntemptation of the [empiricist](../Empiricism.md) tradition.\n\nThe alternative is called *theoretical realism*. Sellars says this is a mistake \n(an example of \"nothing-but-ism\", along with [emotivism](../Emotivism.md) in ethics), originating \nfrom thinking of the difference between observational vocabulary and theoretical \nvocabulary as an ontological difference in the objects referred to by those \ntheories. But it's not an *ontological* distinction, it's a methodological \ndistinction. Two different epistemic relations we can stand in to things that \nthere are. Observable things are those that we come to know about by observation \n(non-inferential observation reports). Theoretical concepts are concepts that\nwe can only be entitled to apply as a result of a process of inference. See \n[Pluto](../Pluto.md) example.\n\n# Ought to be and ought to do\n\nSee distinction: [Ought to be vs ought to do](../Ought%20to%20be%20vs%20ought%20to%20do.md)\n\n# Sense vs reference dependence\n\nSee distinction [Sense dependence vs reference](../Sense%20dependence%20vs%20reference.md)\n\n# Romantic views of language\n\nPeople with romantic views of language: [Derrida](../people/Jaques%20Derrida.md) and [Nietzsche](../people/Frederich%20Nietzsche.md). These are compatible \nwith Wittgenstein [believing language has no downtown](../people/Ludwig%20Wittgenstein.md).\n\nSellars disagrees: the language-language inferential transitions are of the \nfirst importance among those because what makes the entries and exits \n*language* entries and exits is the way they connect to the inferential moves. \nAnd so he would say to Derrida, \"yes, we do all of these other wonderful things \nwith the language, but that's all parasitic on the meanings that things are \ngiven because of the role they play in the space of reasons... now, once you've \ngot that up and running, once you've got those meanings to work with, now you \ncan start to do other playful things with it, e.g. use them metaphorically. All\nsorts of things become possible. But that's in principle a superstructure on \nthis structure.\"\n\n# Transition\n\nSellars story of how 'the light dawns slowly over the whole'.\n\nBoth the infant and [Koko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(gorilla)) the \ngorilla can be trained into a language (in the form of conforming to \nought-to-be's). At some point the human makes a jump - they have the concept and \ncan be a trainer of others. What's the nature of that jump?\n\nFor Sellars, this is a change in *normative status*, not a lightbulb that went \noff in one's head. Like the change on your 21st birthday, when suddenly doing \nthe very same thing, making the same pen scratches that you could have made the \nday before, would *not* be obliging yourself to pay the bank a certain amount of \nmoney every every month for the next 30 years. But after your 21st birthday, \nwhen you scratch your pen in exactly the same (physically descriptively, \nmatter-of-factually) way, all of a sudden it has a hugely different normative\nsignificance because now you will be held responsible. You'll be taken to have\nundertaken commitment in a way in which you were not eligible to undertake that \ncommitment by doing the very same thing descriptively, the day before.\n\nWhen you get good enough at the language game moves, you do get acknowledged by \nthe community. We don't characterize this physically-descriptively because we're \nnot describing someone / some matter-of-factual boundary that has been crossed. \nWe're not describing the child, we're placing the child in the space of reasons.\n\nIt's the difference between the one and a half year old, who toddles in to the \nliving room. And as her first full sentence says, \"Daddy, the house is on fire.\" \nWell, one doesn't think that she has claimed that the house is on fire. She's \nmanaged to put these words together, this is good. If the four year old comes \ninto the living room and says \"Daddy, the house was on fire\", you hold her \nresponsible, you say \"How do you know? Did you smell smoke? And you know, what \nshould we be doing? What follows if the house is on fire? What should we be \ndoing?\" You take her to have claimed this to have undertaken a commitment and \nyou hold her responsible for it. The difference is not some light that's going \non. It's a difference in normative status, ultimately a difference in \n[social status](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md#sapience).\n\nThis is the difference between just conforming to the pattern, and actually \nmaking claims. The radically anti-Cartesian aspect of Sellars is that this is \nalso the the difference between conforming to the pattern and *having thoughts \nat all*.\n\nHowever, as Dennett points out: you can treat any even inanimate object as an \nintentional system, e.g. this table as having the one desire that remain at the \ncenter of the universe. And the one belief that it is currently at the center \nof the universe, which is why it resists us moving it. (by extension, we treat \nour cats and dogs this way). So we should only treat things as thinking if we \nhave to. Brandom takes an opposite view, that you should always treat something \nas talking if you can (note this is a [very high bar](../Novel%20sentences.md).\n\nThe period prior to the child's mastery and social status as a language speaker \nhas some peculiarities. His verbal behavior would express his thoughts but, to \nput it paradoxically, the child could not express them. The child isn't in a \nposition to *intentionally* say that things are thus-and-so, even though it is \nin a position to say that things are thus-and-so. So there's a question: which \ncomes first, speaker's meaning or semantic meaning?\n\nSemantic meaning is a matter of what the words mean. No agent involved in that. \nIn English, the word 'molybdenum' means the noble metal with 42 protons. \nContrast with \"When Humpty Dumpty says 'glory', he means *a nice knockdown, \ndrag-out fight*\". Grice says speaker meaning comes first. Sellars says that is a \nCartesian way of thinking about things, that the primary meaning is what words \nmean in the language process.\n\nIf I claim the notebook is made out of copper, I have (whether I know it or \nnot), committed it to melting at 1084 °C and that it conducts electricity. \nMy words mean those things, whether or not I mean to.\n\nThe kid produces vocal (not yet verbal) noises until he is a member of the \nlanguage community (his verbal noises conform to enough ought-to-be's).\n\nAs soon as he can say something, that's the expression of a thought. To take \nhim to be saying is to be taking him to be thinking out loud. It's a further \nstage, when he can take expressing that thought as the object of an intention, \nand intentionally do as an action that say, before that, that's just an act, \nit's a performance, he can reliably produce appropriately, but not yet \nintentionally produce. An adult could be in this situation: \n[Auction](../Auction.md) example. That's the sort of position that the kid (who's just crossed the line into being able to say something) is: she can produce a vocalization that will hold her responsible \nfor, and which, accordingly, we take to express a thought. But she doesn't yet \nhave the *concept*. So, she can have the concept of its being red or the house \nbeing on fire. But not yet, the concept of *endorsing something*, or of making \na claim that he's saying can be a later development. And you need *that* concept \nin order to *intend* to be making a claim.\n\nImportant to make distinctions between different types of saying:\n\n* mere utterance (position of 1 year old)\n* saying that things are thus-and-so\n  * having mastered the entries/exits/language-language moves, but no \n    metalinguistic concepts\n  * Could be called \"merely thinking out loud\"\n  * Can perform speech *acts*.\n  * Can express that something is read or even a desire for something \n    (\"I'm taking that\")\n* intentionally saying (*telling* someone) that things are thus-and-so\n  * need concepts of asserting/believing as well as concepts of thus-and-so\n  * Can perform speech *actions*.\n  * Self consciousness.\n\nWe need to think of the child as being able to give evidence without the \nconcept of evidence. This is important in the story of how the language game \ngets off the ground with the early hominids. But we have real experience with \nthis: when teaching logic, it's helpful to teach students to have the practical\nmastery of writing proofs (prior to them having the concept of a proof). They\nfirst get familiar with the symbol pushing game. (proof is a strong form of \nevidence). This is very common in mathematics education.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.367687962-05:00","tags":null},"/sellars2009/04-Counterfactuals-and-the-Kant-Sellars-Thesis-2009":{"title":"04 - Counterfactuals and the Kant-Sellars Thesis (2009)","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) [Prev](03%20-%20Language%20as%20thought%20and%20different%20species%20of%20ought%20%282009%29.md)\n\n# Counterfactuals and dispositions\n\nUses [Principia Mathematica](../works/Principia%20Mathematica.md) \nnotation, which takes some time to learn.\n\n[Goodman](../people/Nelson%20Goodman.md) has let the formalism of classical \nextensional logic mislead him in \nthinking about counterfactuals. He thought we could build up to counterfactuals \nfrom extensional logical vocabulary. The kind that can be built up by \nextensional logical vocabulary Sellars calls subjunctive identicals.\n\nGoodman is impressed in [Fact, Fiction, and Forecast](../works/Fact,%20Fiction,%20and%20Forecast.md), with \nthe difference between the claim 'All copper melts at 1084 °C' and 'all the \ncoins in my pocket are copper'. The first supports counterfactual reasoning \n(\"if this coin in my pocket *were* copper, it'd melt at 1084 °C\") whereas if \nthis nickel coin were in my pocket, it wouldn't be made of copper. However we \ncan do some limited form of counterfactual reasoning: \"if I pulled a coin out \nof my pocket, it would be copper\". We can always rephrase such counterfactuals \n(accidental generalizations) as a statement about something identical to an \nactual object. (The distinction is less sharp between genuine counterfactuals \nand subjunctive identicals is less sharp than he thinks, according to Brandom).\n\nSellars makes the distinction of [subjunctive vs counterfactual conditionals](../Subjunctive%20vs%20counterfactual%20conditionals.md).\n\n# Dispositions\n\nSellars' formalization of a disposition:\n\n1. A kind term\n   * More than a mere predicate: in addition to criteria of application, also \n     have criteria of identity and individuation.\n   * Two flavors: proper individuating terms as well as mass terms (which \n     requires something like 'cup of' to individuate)\n1. Condition term\n1. Intervention term\n1. Result term\n\nCanonical example: \"If you put the sugar in water, it will dissolve.\"\n\nDistinct from a capacity claim: \"Sugar has the capacity to dissolve\" is a claim \nthat there exists a condition and intervention such that the result obtain.\n\n# Casual modalities\n\nSellars first big idea: what was needed was a functional theory of concepts \n(especially alethic/normative modalities), which would make their role in \nreasoning, rather than their supposed origin and experience their primary\nfeature. Sellars takes modal expressions to be inference licenses.\n\nJerry Fodor's theory of semantic content in terms of nomological locking: can't \ndirectly say anything about modality directly. Not alone: Dretske and other \nteleosemantic literature. Sellars wants to argue this program will never work.\n\nAn axial idea of [Immanuel Kant](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md): the framework that \nmakes description possible has features which we can express with words (words \nwhose job is not to describe [^5] anything, but rather to make explicit features \nof the framework within which we can describe things).\n\nThe framework is often characterized with laws. With alethic modal vocabulary on \nthe object side, normative vocabulary on the subject side.\n\n[Immanuel Kant](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md) is concerned with features that are \nnecessary conditions of the possibility of applying descriptive contents. How \nare statements like that sensibly thought of as true or false? (where the home \nlanguage game is ordinary descriptive language) Kant says yes, in a sense, but \nhave to be careful. If these kinds of claims are knowledge, what kind of \njustification is involved in it? Can we think of them as expressing even a kind \nof empirical knowledge? (after all, we learned laws of nature empirically, it \nseems). We have to think about the relationship between the framework and what \nyou can say, in the framework, and what you can say about the framework. Kant \nwas the first one worried about all that stuff. Sellars wants to find a meta \nframework for talking about the relations between talk within that framework of \ndescription, and talk about that framework of description.\n\n[^5]: in the narrow sense\n\n# From labels to descriptions\n\n[Semantic nominalism](../Semantic%20nominalism.md) was universally held until Kant. (philosophy today hasn't \nyet graduated from its Humean to its Kantian phase)\n\nIf you could argue that standing in counterfactually, robust inferential \nrelations to other descriptive terms, was an essential feature of the \ndescriptive content of a concept (and you could argue that modal vocabularies \nhad the expressive job of making those explicit), then you'd be in a position \nto argue for the Kant-Sellars thesis about modality. That would be to say that \nthe expressive job of modal vocabulary is to make explicit the inferential \nrelations between descriptive concepts (these are invisible to the empiricist).\n\nFork in road: Hume+Quine, or Kant+Sellars.\n\nLabels are not descriptions. There's more to describing than labeling.\n\nConsider mere labels. Elements on a tray have red or blue dots. Have they been \ndescribed? If so, what have they been described as? If we add things to the \ntray, we don't know whether they deserve red or blue labels. At the very least, \ndescriptions need a practice for applying to new cases. We can throw that in but \nstill not have a description.\n\nSuppose I'm trying to give you the concept of gleeb. I give you an infalliable \ngleebness tester. Do you have a description?\n\n[Author](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md)\n\n \u003e \n \u003e It's only because the expressions in terms of which we describe\n \u003e objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it\n \u003e all rather than merely label.\n\n—  [Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities](../works/Counterfactuals,%20Dispositions,%20and%20the%20Causal%20Modalities.md) §108\n\n* Describing is what science is the measure of all things. But it's more than \n  classifying things.\n* Sellars is raising the issue \"what is description?\"\n\nSellars says \"concepts as classifiers\" is [not enough](../Concepts%20and%20judgment.md) to get to descriptions.\n\nThis is what a mere classifier does.\n\nWhat's the difference between me and a parrot who has been trained to say 'red' \nwhen presented a red object. The parrot isn't describing, but I am because my \nnoise is situated in a space of implications: something follows for me from \nclassifying that thing is red (that it's colored that it's spatially extended, \nthat if it's a Macintosh Apple, it's right). And furthermore, other things can \nbe evidence for the claim that it Scarlet is evidence for it or that it's a \nright Macintosh, Apple is evidence for it. And it excludes other \nclassifications. That monochromatic patch is not green, if it's red, and so on.\n\nThe classifier focuses only on the *circumstances* of application, not the \n*consequences* of application. A way to answer what the red and blue dots \ndescribe an element *as* is to say what follows from something having a blue or \nred dot (e.g. things labelled red are to be discarded). Now we have some \ndescriptive content associated with the label.\n\nVerificationism / classical American pragmatism focused purely on the \n*consequences* of application.\n\nTo say we need both circumstances and consequences is to say that the inferences \nthe concept plays into is an essential part of a concept.\n\nIf the only inferences we could make were truth functional relations, then a \ngleeb detector like thing could be sufficient to capture the concept of gleeb \nfully; however, we care about counterfactually robust inferences.\n\nYou can't count as understanding (i.e. grasp the meaning of) any descriptive \nexpression / concept, unless you distinguish at least some of the inferences \nthat it's involved (i.e. some of the connections within that space of \nimplications) as counterfactually robust (i.e. ones that would still obtain, \neven if something that is true wasn't, or something that isn't true was). The \nclaim is not that there are particular counterfactual inferences you need, but \nthat you need at least *some* to have the concept.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Chestnut trees produce chestnuts\n  * Unless they're immature / blighted\n  * Whether or not it's raining on them now wouldn't affect the fact that \n    chestnut trees produce chestnuts\n* Dry, well-made matches light if you strike them\n  * Not if there's not enough oxygen\n  * The position of a distant beetle on a tree that doesn't affect whether \n    this match lights\n* The hungry lioness would chase the nearby Gazelle\n  * Not if it were struck by lightning\n  * But it would, whether or not the hyena were watching it\n\nQ: do we have to have overlap in our distinctions we made to communicate about \nthe same concept?\n\nA: The conceptual content itself is a norm that settles which inferences are \ncorrect and which are incorrect. Then, you and I may have different views about \nwhere that line is drawn. And what makes it possible for us to communicate (to \nagree or to disagree) is that we've bound ourselves by the same norm by using \nthe same word. You may think the melting point of copper is different from what \nI think it is. But we can still be disagreeing about copper because there's a \nfact of the matter about what you're committed to, on that issue, when you use \nthe word 'copper'.\n\nQ: Is this a counter-example? You are asked to bring a thing to your lab (it \njust landed from an alien planet - you can't make any inferences about it).\n\nA: It's complicated. Firstly, 'thing' or 'object' is not a sortal - you can't \ncount them (they're pro-sortals, placeholders for sortals). If we supply one \n(e.g. place-occupying piece of mass - which would suffice give us some \ncounterfactually robust inferences). If you don't supply one, you haven't \nthought about it. Related to Wittgenstein's [plate example](../Pointing%20at%20a%20plate.md).\n\n[Immanuel Kant](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md) says concepts are rules for judgment we \n[bind ourselves by](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md#concepts). That doesn't settle the question of how much of the law we need to know in order to bind ourselves by it. I don't have to know much about molybdenum to refer to molybdenum.\n\n# Semantic nominalism\n\nSemantic paradigm is the \"name-bearer\" relationship. E.g. the 'Fido'-Fido \nrelation, between the name 'Fido' and the dog, Fido. Predicates/properties are \njust names that stick to the set.\n\nIf we stick together labels, we get descriptions (not a primitive name bearer \nrelation, but one we can understand in terms of name-bearer relations). That's \nwhat language lets us do. Describe/classify things (as falling under languages).\n\nSellars calls this [descriptivism](../Descriptivism.md): what you do with language is describe things.\n\nYou find this not only in anglophone tradition but also in a pure form in \nHussurl / semiotics. [Derrida](../people/Jaques%20Derrida.md) rejects Hussurl because there are \nsome phenomena that can't be related by sign-signified relations, but he \naddresses it by saying it's all signs.\n\nKant found sentences special: you don't describe things with them, you say \nthings with them. Theory of judgment. The [Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus](../works/Tractatus%20Logico-Philosophicus.md) has no \nroom for statements of natural law. For normative statements, it retreats into mysticism.\n\n[Semantic nominalism](../Semantic%20nominalism.md) is atomistic - the relation of a name and its bearer \ndoesn't turn on anything else.\n\n# Kant-Sellars thesis\n\nFrom three premises:\n\n1. what you need to move from [Labeling](../Labeling.md) to describing is situation in a space of \n   implications\n1. space of implications must draw lines between implications that will between \n   counterfactual circumstances under which the implication would still be good, \n   and those in which wouldn't\n1. the expressive job, not in the first instance, a descriptive job that's \n   characteristic of modal vocabulary is to make explicit those range those \n   implications and those ranges of counterfactual robustness\n\nPut another way, suppose Sellars is right that modal expressions function as \ninference licenses. If it could be argued that those counterfactually robust \ninferences are essential to articulating the content of ordinary empirical \ndescriptive concepts, then you'd have an argument to the effect that the \ncapacity to use modal concepts what modal concepts make explicit is implicit \nalready in the use even of ordinary empirical, descriptive, non modal concepts.\n\nIt's explicit in [Sellars](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md), all but explicit in [Kant](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md). Some consequences:\n\n* [modal](../Modality.md) vocabulary is not something that you can casually add to [ordinary descriptive vocabulary](../Ordinary%20descriptive%20vocabulary.md), like culinary vocabulary. Rather, the distinctive \n  expressive job of modal vocabulary is to articulate the inferential \n  connections among descriptive concepts in virtue of which they have the \n  content that they do.\n\n* just in being able to use ordinary empirical descriptive vocabulary, non\n  modal vocabulary anyone already knows how to do everything they need to know \n  how to do in order to use modal vocabulary. They merely make explicit what is \n  implicit in non-modal concepts.\n\n* One cannot be in the predicamant that Hume took himself to be in. We can \n  teach you how to use modal vocabulary. You may not have a word for it yet. \n  That's what we'll give you. But you already know how to *do* everything you \n  need to know how to do to use that word to talk with 'necessity', \n  'possibility' and the subjunctive.\n\n* Description and explanation are two sides of one coin.\n\n# Modal revolution in the 20th century\n\nRevolution in Anglophone philosophy, taking three phases:\n\n1. Kripke's  [possible worlds semantics](../Possible%20worlds%20semantics.md)  for modal logic (algebraic properties \n   accessibility relation determine which modal system we're in)\n   * Quine was a skeptic of modal talk, said that we didn't know what we really \n     meant when talking about it.\n   * His concerns became unpopular with this development, as Kripke's semantics \n     gave people the impression that we had a grasp on what we meant (in fact, \n     alethic modal talk became the philosophical ground level for explaining \n     other puzzling things (such as intentionality)).\n   * Quine thinks his objection is not yet satisfied; of course we can explain \n     modal concepts in terms of other modal concepts - what do we mean by \n     *possible world*? What do we mean by *accessibility*?\n1. The previous development is only for modal logic, but Montague, David Kaplan, \n   [David Lewis](../people/David%20Lewis.md), Stalnaker, etc. extended \n   it to work for non-logical semantics as well. See, for example, Lewis' [General Semantics](../works/General%20Semantics.md)\n1. Kripke's [Naming and Necessity](../works/Naming%20and%20Necessity.md)\n\n* Introduced us to contingent *a priori* and metaphysical necessity\n\nBrandom says: the second is the most important, but Quine's objection was not \naddressed by Kripke's semantics nor the fact that it's useful in semantics to be \nable to use Kripke's apparatus. The reason why we should have gained \ncomfortablity with alethic modal language is actually the [Kant-Sellars thesis](../Kant-Sellars%20thesis.md), \nwhich dispels empiricist worries of modal concepts being unintelligible.\n\nBut hardly anyone knows about that argument. If they did, it would color our \ncurrent focuses and interests. For the Kant-Sellars thesis pertains to \ncausal/physical modalities. But nowadays, the center of philosophical thought \nworries about logical modalities and metaphysical modalities - causal modality \nis boring to them. \"We're distracted by the shiny, new playground that Kripke \noffered us and lost sight of the modality that's philosophically most \nsignificant.\"\n\n# Debate between Mr C and Mr E\n\n|Name|Mr C|Mr E|\n|----|----|----|\n|Stands for|constant conjunction|entailment|\n|Represents|empiricists|rationalists|\n|Core of truth|statements of necessary connection do not describe matter of factual states of affairs|what you're *doing* when you make a modal claim is endorsing the propriety of a pattern of material inference|\n|Core mistake|the only thing you can do with language is describe matter of factual states of affairs (therefore, laws must be descriptions of regularities)|statements of necessity describe entailment (still a descriptivist POV)|\n\nSellars take the dialectic through many turns instead of just saying what he \nthinks. He pretends to be even-handed until deciding to focus on tweaking \nMr E.'s theory to make it work.\n\nNeed to distinguish four related types of claims:\n\n1. The practical endorsement of infering that things are $B$'s from their being\n   $A$'s.\n   * This is presupposed by the act of describing (Kant-Sellars thesis)\n1. The explicit statement that one may infer the applicability of $B$ from the \n   applicability of $A$\n   * This can be asserted without understanding the expressions $A$ and $B$\n   * I.e., it's syntactic; just a statement about the use of language\n   * Someone who doesn't speak German can still say \"If $x$ is 'rot', then $x$ \n     is 'farbig'.\"\n1. The statement that $A$ physically entails $B$\n1. The statement that $A$'s are necessarily $B$'s.\n\nMr E was getting the *content* of modal statements wrong; they aren't *about* \nlanguage.\n\nThat some inference is ok is something that is *conveyed* by a modal claim, but \nit is not what is *said*. (Analogy: John *says/asserts/means* \"The weather is \ngood today\", but John *conveys* \"John thinks the weather is good today\" and John \n*does not say* \"John thinks the weather is good today.\"). Related to this \n[quote](../quotes/Transposed%20language%20of%20norms.md).\n\nWhat Sellars' conclusion ought to be: what one is *doing* in making a modal \nassertion is endorsing a pattern of material inference. No need to take a stand \non semantics. This is an expressivist view of modal vocabulary. Analogous to \nexpressivism in ethics: what you are *doing* in saying someone ought to do $X$ \nis endorsing doing $X$. We can try to understand the semantic/descriptive \ncontent\\footnote{We cannot deny there is any descriptive content due to the\n[Frege-Geach argument](../Frege-Geach%20argument.md) in terms of what one is *doing* when we use the expressions.)\n\n# What makes modal claims true?\n\nSellars wants to say it is the correctness of inferences connecting descriptive \nterms that make modal claims. Simultaneously, modal claims do not *say* anything \nabout inferences.\n\nIt's important that notion of *saying* is wider than *describing*. This is the \ndenial of semantic descriptivism.\n\nThe pragmatic force associated with the modal claim is endorsing a pattern of \ninference.\n\nWhat one says is that being a $B$ follows from being an $A$. This is not a \nstatement *about* inferences, it is a statement about a consequential relation. \nWhen one says \"$x$ being copper is incompatible with $x$ being an insulator\", \none is making a claim about the world (even if it is not describing it in the \nnarrow sense). These are facts about what follows from what in the world. Given \nthe auxillary hypothesis that our word 'copper' means *copper*, there are things \nwe can say about inferences, but the fact that we need that auxillary hypothesis \nis proof that the statement itself isn't about inferences.\n\nSo modal claims are descriptive in the wide sense but not the narrow sense.\n\nThere are some serious concerns, though. Consider \"There exist causal \nconnections which have not yet been discovered\". This is analogous to accepting \nthe early emotivist line in ethics (thinking 'ought' is a perfectly good concept, \nthough not a descriptive one ... such that 'Everybody ought to keep promises' \ncontextually implies a wish, on the speaker's part, that promise keeping were a \nuniversal practice), and was then confronted with such statements as \"There are \nobligations which have not yet been recognized\" and \"Some of the things we think \nof as obligations are not obligations\"\n\n \u003e \n \u003e It is therefore important to realize that the presence in the object language \n \u003e of the causal modalities (and of the logical modalities and of the deontic \n \u003e modalities) serves not only to express existing commitments, but also to provide \n \u003e the framework for the thinking by which we reason our way (in a manner \n \u003e appropriate to the specific subject matter) into the making of new commitments \n \u003e and the abandoning of old. And since this framework essentially involves \n \u003e quantification over predicate variables, puzzles over the 'existence of \n \u003e abstract entities' are almost as responsible for the prevalence in the \n \u003e empiricist tradition of 'nothing-but-ism' in its various forms (emotivism, \n \u003e philosophical behaviorism, phenomenalism) as its tendency to assimilate all \n \u003e discourse to describing.\n\nIf we are to take causal modalities, seriously / at face value, we're going to \nhave to worry about what abstract objects and what properties are.\n\nBrandom thinks Sellars could have a simpler/more satisfying conclusion to the \nessay, but Sellars' nominalism (denial of existence for abstract \nobjects/properties) prevents him from doing so.\n\nIn Brandom's view, [material inferences](../Material%20inference%20vs%20logical%20inference.md) are [not monotonic](../Nonmonotonic%20logic.md). The job of some \nscientific languages is to find concepts where we can state monotonic \nconsequence relations. We can do that in fundamental physics, but hardly ever \nin the special sciences.\n\n# Relation to Hegel\n\n[Hegel](../people/Georg%20Wilhelm%20Friedrich%20Hegel.md) says, \"By conceptual, I mean, what's articulated by relations of \ndeterminant negation [^1] and mediation [^2]\".[^3] He says, the objective world, \nas it is, independently of our activities, is conceptually articulated. It has \na conceptual structure because he's a modal realist about it.\n\nHe thinks there are laws of nature. He thinks some things really follow from \nother things. For instance, that if a body with finite mass is accelerated, then \na force was applied to it. he thinks that's a consequence, and the remaining \nrelatively at rest, and having a force supplied you those are incompatible.\nThose are incompatible properties.\n\nSo he says, the objective world has a conceptual structure already that has \nnothing to do with our conceiving activity. We can see that as something else. \nYes, our commitments can also stand in relations of material consequence and in \ncompatibility, but the world, just as it comes, is already in conceptual shape.\n\n[^1]: i.e. material incompatibility\n[^2]: i.e. material consequence\n[^3]: Brandom says this is expressed, beginning in the section on perception of \n[Phenomenology of Spirit](../works/Phenomenology%20of%20Spirit.md).\n\n# Utility of possible worlds semantics\n\nLet 'possible world' *mean* a physically possible world [^4]. This conceptual \napparatus can be thought of  simply as a way of expressing what it is for two \nproperties to be incompatible or to stand in a material consequential relation.\n\nSo we can express (in the language of possible worlds) the fact that it follows \nfrom (as a consequence) something's being copper that it melts at 1084 °C, for \nexample.\n\n[David Lewis](../people/David%20Lewis.md) is presented as an example of \nmisusing possible world semantics. He \ndiscards the connection between inference and the possible worlds. He takes the \ndescriptivist position that all one can do is describe with language, but then \nsays he is not an actualist (you can describe non-actual worlds in the same \nsense that you can describe the coin in your pocket as copper).\n\nWhat is lost by merging description in the narrow sense and description in the \nwide sense? The connection to semantics. We've also gained an additional problem \nof justifying our claims to knowledge of the non-actual worlds.\n\n[^4]: not just metaphysically possible world, whatever that is\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.345089829-05:00","tags":null},"/sellars2019/Sellars-Lecture-1-2019":{"title":"Sellars Lecture 1 (2019)","content":"\n[Author](../people/Robert%20Brandom.md) \n\nSellars is a *great* philosopher.

This changed in the late 60's (due to Strawson/Rawls). \n\nFour of his ideas mattered a lot to Kant.\n\n## 1. Kant's normative turn\n\nNormative understanding of understanding / discursive practice. Discursive for \nKant *means* pertaining to concept usage (i.e. distinct from mere utterances / \nnoises).\n\n* Kant saw that what distinguishes judgment (cognitive side) and intentionality (on practical side)\n  from habitual/learned responses from ordinary creatures:\n  * They are things the agents/knowers are *responsible for*.\n  * They are exercises of the authority of the agents/knowers (the authority \n    to make ourselves responsible).\n\nThis is something Kant shares with later Wittgenstein (e.g. [a children's game](../A%20children's%20game.md)).\n\nDifference between \"us\" and \"it\" is not ontological but rather *de*ontological.\n\nThe minimum unit of awareness/experiences is the *judgment* (the minimum unit \nyou can take responsibility for),[not the concept](../Concepts%20and%20judgment.md). \n\n## 2. Rousseau's criterion of freedom into a definition of the normative\n\n* [Rousseau](../people/Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau.md) said \n  \"Obedience to a law that one has laid oneself is freedom.\"\n* Kant turned this around to distinguish *constraint by norms* from \n  *constraint by power*.\n* Discussed in [Some Reflections on Language Games](../works/Some%20reflections%20on%20language%20games.md).\n\n## 3. Non-descriptive concepts\n\nIn addition to concepts whose principle expressive job is to describe/explain \nempirical goings-on, there are concepts whose principle expressive job it is \nto make explicit the framework that makes description possible.\n\n* These are known *a priori* framework-explicating concepts \n  (pure concepts of the understanding).\n* This is Kant's response to [David Hume](../people/David%20Hume.md), \n  for how we can understand the modal force \n  of laws in virtue of their non-modal description.\n  * The answer is in the description framework itself.\n  * The fact that there are necessarily relations that concepts have among \n    another makes description possible (a concept being contentful at all \n    requires it to have some necessary relations to other concepts).\n\nWhat Sellars means by 'ushering philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian \nphase' is putting categories front and center.\n\n* Trying to *describe* the modal structure of the world or describe the \n  space of possible worlds is to try to assimilate modal language into \n  [descriptivism](../Descriptivism.md), rather than seeing \n  them as playing a different expressive role\n* Sellars saw Kant as putting this other option on the table.\n\n## [Noumena and phenomena](../Noumena%20and%20phenomena.md)\n\nIn the eyes of Hegel/Sellars/Brandom, [Kant](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md) is interpreted as having radicalized the distinction between:\n\n* primary qualities (properties that are truly there)\n* secondary qualities (properties that are due to us).\n\nHe challenges us to divide the labor:\n\n* what features is the *world responsible for*?\n* what features are *we responsible for*?\n  * E.g. the fact our theories are expressed in German/English\n\nThis distinction lives in [Sellars](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md) as the difference between:\n\n* the world *in the narrow sense*\n* the world *in the wider sense*\n  * E.g. which includes norms that are only accessible from a \n    participant's perspective.\n\nHegel and Brandom think that, even if it was Kant's idea, that it is a *bad*\nidea (but it's one that Sellars took from Kant).\n\n## Some historical context\n\nFreiburg / Marburg schools of neo-Kantianism.\n\nSee [SEP](/https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neo-kantianism/)\n\nSellars figured out that Carnap was actually a neo-Kantian even though Carnap \ndid not see himself this way. Carnap opened Sellars' eyes to \"the new way of \nwords\".\n\nAmerican pragmatism also saw Kantian ideas updated in an empiricist mode.\n\nQuine got empiricism from CI Lewis, not his Kantianism. Sellars got \nKantianism from CI Lewis.\n\nEarly Heidegger (of *Being and Time*) had strong neo-Kantian themes, in Brandom's \nanalysis, but it was pointed out to Brandom by Brun Christianen that those \nelements were precisely the ones that Heidegger inherited from his teacher \nRicard, that he had not freed himself from. (late Heidegger looked back and \nrepudiated this work as a \"merely anthropological work\".)\n\nMoral of this historical aside: insidious neo-Kantianism - you can't be sure \nwhether you've been infected or not.\n\n## Development of Sellars thought\n\nRoywood Sellars was Sellars' father, a successful philosopher.\n\nUndergrad philosophy in Michigan working with his father. MA working on \nHussurl's phenomenology (you can see his father's critical realism showing \nstrongly in that thesis). He was a wrestler and a fencer. Failed to write a Kant \ndissertation at Oxford, came to Harvard to work with Quine.\n\nSellars had spent 10 years in academia without publishing anything.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.391363184-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Aesthetic-Problems-of-Modern-Philosophy":{"title":"Aesthetic Problems of Modern Philosophy","content":"\n[Author](../people/Stanley%20Cavell.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.243797444-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Counterfactuals-Dispositions-and-the-Causal-Modalities":{"title":"Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities","content":"\n[Author](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md)\n\n\\[-@sellars1958counterfactuals\\]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.220145972-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Critique-of-Pure-Reason":{"title":"Critique of Pure Reason","content":"\n[Author](../people/Immanuel%20Kant.md)\n\n\\[-@smith2011immanuel\\]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.39186977-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Empiricism-and-the-Philosophy-of-Mind":{"title":"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind","content":"\n[Author](../people/Wilfrid%20Sellars.md)\n\n\\[-@sellars1956empiricism\\]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.3685333-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Ethics-Spinoza":{"title":"Ethics (Spinoza)","content":"\n[Author](../people/Baruch%20Spinoza.md)\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.305646307-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Experience-and-Nature":{"title":"Experience and Nature","content":"\n[Author](../people/John%20Dewey.md)\n\n\\[-@dewey1958experience\\]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.239161459-05:00","tags":null},"/works/Fact-Fiction-and-Forecast":{"title":"Fact, Fiction, and Forecast","content":"\n[Author](../people/Nelson%20Goodman.md)\n\n\\[-@goodman1983fact\\]\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-27T20:33:11.418517176-05:00","tags":null},"/works/General-Semantics":{"title":"General Semantics","content":"\n[Author](../people/David%20Lewis.md)\n\n\\[-@lewis1976general\\]\n\n# Takeaway\n\nIf we decide to treat objects as semantic interpretant of our names, sets of possible worlds as \nthe semantic interpretant of our sentences, then: \n\n* one-place predicates correspond to *functions* from objects to sets of possible worlds.\n* 'walks' is a function from objects to the worlds in which that object is \n  walking.\n* adverbs, like 'slowly', is a function from one-place predicates to \n  one-place predicates.\n\nThis apparatus gives us a way to talk *precisely* about certain distinctions that come up in philosophy language.
