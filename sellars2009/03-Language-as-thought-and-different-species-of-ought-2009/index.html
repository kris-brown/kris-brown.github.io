intentional concepts into purely behavior characterizations / dispositions to
publicly observable behavior (specified in a non-intentional vocabulary).</p><p>Introduced in
<a href=../../works/Empiricism-and-the-Philosophy-of-Mind/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../works/Empiricism-and-the-Philosophy-of-Mind/>Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind</a> (9 years earlier), distinct
from what he here calls logical behaviorism. <em>Logical behaviorism</em> refers to a
view he attributes to Ryle. JB Watson and BF Skinner promoted this in psychology.
Sellars never endorsed this because he saw this as being an application of
<a href=../../Instrumentalism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Instrumentalism/>instrumentalism</a> in the philosophy of science.</p><p>Observable things, at least we know they exist. Theoretical things, we&rsquo;ve got to
make risky inferences to get to them. But we can also make observational
mistakes. Not just &ldquo;I thought it was a fox but it was a dog&rdquo;, but categorical
observational mistakes. We can give some concept an observational role (e.g.
declare that we can observe X&rsquo;s) yet no X&rsquo;s exist, i.e. no thing has such no
thing with such circumstances of application and consequences of application.
E.g.
<a href=../../Sour-acid/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Sour-acid/>sour acid</a> and
<a href=../../Referring-to-witches/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Referring-to-witches/>referring to witches</a> examples.</p><p><em>The Plasticity of Mind</em> is about bad theories incorporating observational
practices, i.e. &ldquo;What do you mean there are no K&rsquo;s. I can <em>see</em> K&rsquo;s, there&rsquo;s one
right there!&rdquo;</p><p>So again, this is a response to someone saying we can distinguish theoretical
from observable entities by pointing to the fact that we can make mistakes about
whole categories of theoretical entities. Furthermore,
<a href=../../Pluto/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Pluto/>Pluto</a> is a great counterexample for this
distinction.</p><p>Just because our evidence for attributing mental states comes from behavior does
not mean, unless you are an instrumentalist, that you have to be able to define
intentional concepts in terms of behavior. (This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the intentional
states are less real, just that we aren&rsquo;t in a position to observe anything but
the behavior)</p><a href=#digressions><h2 id=digressions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Digressions</h2></a><ol><li><p><a href=../../Semantics/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Semantics/>Semantics</a> is a field with instrumentalist vs theoretical realist views.
<a href=../../people/Michael-Dummett/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Michael-Dummett/>Michael Dummett</a> is an instrumentalist
by observing the fact that meaning something
is only understood through verbal behavior and concluding that any theory of
meaning must be definable in terms of behavior.</p><ul><li>(A theoretical realist might postulate meanings as theoretical entities to
explain verbal behavior and say our access to meanings is inferential and,
if they are good theories, then verbal behavior gives us inferential
access to something (meanings) that exist.)</li></ul></li><li><p><a href=../../people/John-MacDowell/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/John-MacDowell/>MacDowell</a> and Sellars agree
(and disagree with almost all others) that what
you hear when someone talks to you is the words themselves, rather than
hearing noises and (by some inferential process) constructing the words.
You have to actually actively do some work to hear that mere noises. This is
evidenced by how difficult it was to tell computers how to recognize a smile
in a picture.</p><ul><li>(Some say it&rsquo;s a contradiction to say that meanings are essentially
normative yet, on the other hand, we sometimes can directly perceive them.
But there&rsquo;s nothing in principle unobservable about normative states of
affairs - see Sellars&rsquo; criteria of observation below)</li></ul></li></ol><p>(Controversial) Criteria for observation:</p><ol><li>You have the capacity to reliably and differentially respond to some
normative state of affairs</li><li>You have to have the concept and which is a matter of inferential
articulation and practical mastery of inferential proprieties, involving it.
And then if you can hook the one up to the other, you&rsquo;ve turned what was
beforehand a theoretical concept for you into into the concept of an
observable/</li></ol><p>Sellars wants to make sense of the notion of &ldquo;language as a rule-governed
enterprise&rdquo; (as essentially involving norms). Sellars believes that if your
account language doesn&rsquo;t involve norms, you will be describing the vehicles by
which we communicate, rather than what we&rsquo;re saying/meaning.</p><p>Reminder that, due to the
<a href=../../Regress-of-rules/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Regress-of-rules/>regress argument</a>,
that we need to broaden our notion of &lsquo;rule&rsquo; from just explicit rules and need
think of rules also as implicit in what we do. Sellars wants to better
understand the relationship between implicit practical abilities and explicit
representations of rules.</p><p>The question of whether meaning is a normative concept was brought to
philosophical attention by
<a href=../../works/Wittgenstein-on-Rules-and-Private-Language/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../works/Wittgenstein-on-Rules-and-Private-Language/>Kripkenstein</a>. In present literature, Hattiangadi and Katherin Glüer have pushed back upon the idea that it is a normative concept, advanced by Brandom and MacDowell. Brandom feels it is because they haven&rsquo;t learned lessons from Sellars, in particular thinking of norms purely in terms of explicit presecriptions and not making the distinction
between ought-to-be&rsquo;s and ought-to-do&rsquo;s.</p><blockquote><p>You can define <em>possibility</em> in terms of <em>not</em> and <em>necessity</em>. You can define
<em>necessity</em> in terms of <em>not</em> and <em>possibility</em>. I think it&rsquo;s the beginning of
wisdom to think of defining <em>not</em> in terms of the relationship between
<em>possibility</em> and <em>necessity</em>, but I&rsquo;m the only human being who thinks that.</p></blockquote><p><a href=../../people/Paul-Grice/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Paul-Grice/>Grice</a> on non-natural meaning: reduces what
a linguistic expression $P$ means in
terms of the meanings of thoughts and beliefs of those uttering $P$. Sellars
isn&rsquo;t satisfied with this: the puzzling phenomena of meaning are common to both
thought and language.</p><p>Sellars says &ldquo;ought-to-be&rsquo;s imply ought-to-do&rsquo;s&rdquo; but is not exact about what
quantifier: all or some? Brandom thinks &lsquo;some&rsquo; makes more sense, since there
could be an ought-to-be requiring a state of affairs to change without telling
us who has to do what to fix it (you need auxillary hypotheses to turn it into
an ought-to-do). E.g. &ldquo;all clocks should be in sync&rdquo;.</p><p>With a trainer, someone with concepts/rules can condition language learners to
shape their behavior (teach them ought-to-be&rsquo;s). It&rsquo;s important that it&rsquo;s
possible for the language enterprise get off the ground (i.e. without trainers).
It&rsquo;s possible for some sort of selection process to naturally reinforce
ought-to-be&rsquo;s (can be social but the conditioners need not be doing so intentionally).</p><p>We can deliberate making a distinction between ought-to-be&rsquo;s in the context of
humans vs nonliving/nonsentient beings (e.g. &ldquo;plants ought to get enough water&rdquo;).
[[Ruth Millikan]&rsquo;]s work relevant.
Connects to the
<a href=../../people/Aristotle/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Aristotle/>Aristotelian</a> account.</p><p>Consider ought to be&rsquo;s in the context of training animals: These rats ought to
be in state $\phi$ whenever $\psi$.</p><ul><li>Could be just for rats, qua rats</li><li>they ought to be eating when they&rsquo;re hungry, or something like that</li><li>this could be something we want the rats to do<ul><li>when they come to a branch in a maze, the rats go to the side that&rsquo;s painted
blue and not to the side that&rsquo;s painted red.</li><li>That&rsquo;s a regularity that ought to be not because we can read it off of the
fundamental teleology of rats</li><li>The conformity of the rats in question to this rule does <em>not</em> require that
they have a <em>concept</em> $C$, e.g. of colors blue and red. We just require them
to respond properly certain to differences emanating from $C$. This doesn&rsquo;t
require even consciousness (photocells can respond differentially to colors).</li></ul></li></ul><p>&ldquo;Recognitional capacity&rdquo; gets systematically used in two fundamentally different
senses (an &lsquo;accordion word&rsquo;)</p><ul><li>reliable, differential response</li><li>applying a concept</li></ul><p>Important for Sellars that following an ought-to-be requires only the former
sense.</p><p>We should talk about learning a language as &lsquo;coming into the language&rsquo; rather
than &rsquo;learning a language&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s more like the way one comes into a city. You
come to be able to take part in an ongoing practice, as opposed to getting some
intellectual insight.</p><p>Teaching the very young child to say &lsquo;purple&rsquo; when showing her a purple lolipop
is getting her to follow an ought-to-be just like the rat example. There is an
ought-to-do for teachers of a language that they see to it that children produce
the appropriate responses. This presupposes that the teachers do have a
conceptual framework of &lsquo;purple&rsquo; and of &lsquo;vocalize&rsquo; and what it is for an action
to be called by a circumstance. The learner is not required to have any of these
concepts. The ought-to-be is explicit in the teacher&rsquo;s mind.</p><h1 id=instrumentalisminstrumentalismmd><a href=../../Instrumentalism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Instrumentalism/>Instrumentalism</a></h1><p>All of our evidence in science comes from empirical observation, so all of our
concepts (and claims) must be translatable without remainder into observational
vocabulary.</p><p>What warrant would there be for any conceptual excess beyond the language of our
evidence?</p><p>There aren&rsquo;t really any theoretical entities. We postulate them merely to
characterize regularities of observable entities. Statements in the
observational language are simply true or false, whereas statements in
theoretical language are merely more or less useful.</p><p>This is a view that members of the Vienna Circle flirted with. A permanent
temptation of the
<a href=../../Empiricism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Empiricism/>empiricist</a> tradition.</p><p>The alternative is called <em>theoretical realism</em>. Sellars says this is a mistake
(an example of &ldquo;nothing-but-ism&rdquo;, along with
<a href=../../Emotivism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Emotivism/>emotivism</a> in ethics), originating
from thinking of the difference between observational vocabulary and theoretical
vocabulary as an ontological difference in the objects referred to by those
theories. But it&rsquo;s not an <em>ontological</em> distinction, it&rsquo;s a methodological
distinction. Two different epistemic relations we can stand in to things that
there are. Observable things are those that we come to know about by observation
(non-inferential observation reports). Theoretical concepts are concepts that
we can only be entitled to apply as a result of a process of inference. See
<a href=../../Pluto/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Pluto/>Pluto</a> example.</p><a href=#ought-to-be-and-ought-to-do><h1 id=ought-to-be-and-ought-to-do><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Ought to be and ought to do</h1></a><p>See distinction:

first importance among those because what makes the entries and exits
<em>language</em> entries and exits is the way they connect to the inferential moves.
And so he would say to Derrida, &ldquo;yes, we do all of these other wonderful things
with the language, but that&rsquo;s all parasitic on the meanings that things are
given because of the role they play in the space of reasons&mldr; now, once you&rsquo;ve
got that up and running, once you&rsquo;ve got those meanings to work with, now you
can start to do other playful things with it, e.g. use them metaphorically. All
sorts of things become possible. But that&rsquo;s in principle a superstructure on
this structure.&rdquo;</p><a href=#transition><h1 id=transition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Transition</h1></a><p>Sellars story of how &rsquo;the light dawns slowly over the whole&rsquo;.</p><p>Both the infant and

gorilla can be trained into a language (in the form of conforming to
ought-to-be&rsquo;s). At some point the human makes a jump - they have the concept and
can be a trainer of others. What&rsquo;s the nature of that jump?</p><p>For Sellars, this is a change in <em>normative status</em>, not a lightbulb that went
off in one&rsquo;s head. Like the change on your 21st birthday, when suddenly doing
the very same thing, making the same pen scratches that you could have made the
day before, would <em>not</em> be obliging yourself to pay the bank a certain amount of
money every every month for the next 30 years. But after your 21st birthday,
when you scratch your pen in exactly the same (physically descriptively,
matter-of-factually) way, all of a sudden it has a hugely different normative
significance because now you will be held responsible. You&rsquo;ll be taken to have
undertaken commitment in a way in which you were not eligible to undertake that
commitment by doing the very same thing descriptively, the day before.</p><p>When you get good enough at the language game moves, you do get acknowledged by
the community. We don&rsquo;t characterize this physically-descriptively because we&rsquo;re
not describing someone / some matter-of-factual boundary that has been crossed.
We&rsquo;re not describing the child, we&rsquo;re placing the child in the space of reasons.</p><p>It&rsquo;s the difference between the one and a half year old, who toddles in to the
living room. And as her first full sentence says, &ldquo;Daddy, the house is on fire.&rdquo;
Well, one doesn&rsquo;t think that she has claimed that the house is on fire. She&rsquo;s
managed to put these words together, this is good. If the four year old comes
into the living room and says &ldquo;Daddy, the house was on fire&rdquo;, you hold her
responsible, you say &ldquo;How do you know? Did you smell smoke? And you know, what
should we be doing? What follows if the house is on fire? What should we be
doing?&rdquo; You take her to have claimed this to have undertaken a commitment and
you hold her responsible for it. The difference is not some light that&rsquo;s going
on. It&rsquo;s a difference in normative status, ultimately a difference in
<a href=../../people/Robert-Brandom/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Robert-Brandom/>social status</a>.</p><p>This is the difference between just conforming to the pattern, and actually
making claims. The radically anti-Cartesian aspect of Sellars is that this is
also the the difference between conforming to the pattern and <em>having thoughts
at all</em>.</p><p>However, as Dennett points out: you can treat any even inanimate object as an
intentional system, e.g. this table as having the one desire that remain at the
center of the universe. And the one belief that it is currently at the center
of the universe, which is why it resists us moving it. (by extension, we treat
our cats and dogs this way). So we should only treat things as thinking if we
have to. Brandom takes an opposite view, that you should always treat something
as talking if you can (note this is a
<a href=../../Novel-sentences/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Novel-sentences/>very high bar</a>.</p><p>The period prior to the child&rsquo;s mastery and social status as a language speaker
has some peculiarities. His verbal behavior would express his thoughts but, to
put it paradoxically, the child could not express them. The child isn&rsquo;t in a
position to <em>intentionally</em> say that things are thus-and-so, even though it is
in a position to say that things are thus-and-so. So there&rsquo;s a question: which
comes first, speaker&rsquo;s meaning or semantic meaning?</p><p>Semantic meaning is a matter of what the words mean. No agent involved in that.
In English, the word &lsquo;molybdenum&rsquo; means the noble metal with 42 protons.
Contrast with &ldquo;When Humpty Dumpty says &lsquo;glory&rsquo;, he means <em>a nice knockdown,
drag-out fight</em>&rdquo;. Grice says speaker meaning comes first. Sellars says that is a
Cartesian way of thinking about things, that the primary meaning is what words
mean in the language process.</p><p>If I claim the notebook is made out of copper, I have (whether I know it or
not), committed it to melting at 1084 °C and that it conducts electricity.
My words mean those things, whether or not I mean to.</p><p>The kid produces vocal (not yet verbal) noises until he is a member of the
language community (his verbal noises conform to enough ought-to-be&rsquo;s).</p><p>As soon as he can say something, that&rsquo;s the expression of a thought. To take
him to be saying is to be taking him to be thinking out loud. It&rsquo;s a further
stage, when he can take expressing that thought as the object of an intention,
and intentionally do as an action that say, before that, that&rsquo;s just an act,
it&rsquo;s a performance, he can reliably produce appropriately, but not yet
intentionally produce. An adult could be in this situation:
<a href=../../Auction/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Auction/>Auction</a> example. That&rsquo;s the sort of position that the kid (who&rsquo;s just crossed the line into being able to say something) is: she can produce a vocalization that will hold her responsible
for, and which, accordingly, we take to express a thought. But she doesn&rsquo;t yet
have the <em>concept</em>. So, she can have the concept of its being red or the house
being on fire. But not yet, the concept of <em>endorsing something</em>, or of making
a claim that he&rsquo;s saying can be a later development. And you need <em>that</em> concept
in order to <em>intend</em> to be making a claim.</p><p>Important to make distinctions between different types of saying:</p><ul><li>mere utterance (position of 1 year old)</li><li>saying that things are thus-and-so<ul><li>having mastered the entries/exits/language-language moves, but no
metalinguistic concepts</li><li>Could be called &ldquo;merely thinking out loud&rdquo;</li><li>Can perform speech <em>acts</em>.</li><li>Can express that something is read or even a desire for something
(&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking that&rdquo;)</li></ul></li><li>intentionally saying (<em>telling</em> someone) that things are thus-and-so<ul><li>need concepts of asserting/believing as well as concepts of thus-and-so</li><li>Can perform speech <em>actions</em>.</li><li>Self consciousness.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We need to think of the child as being able to give evidence without the
concept of evidence. This is important in the story of how the language game
gets off the ground with the early hominids. But we have real experience with
this: when teaching logic, it&rsquo;s helpful to teach students to have the practical
mastery of writing proofs (prior to them having the concept of a proof). They
first get familiar with the symbol pushing game. (proof is a strong form of
evidence). This is very common in mathematics education.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://kris-brown.github.io/js/graph.abd4bc2af3869a96524d7d23b76152c7.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Kris Brown using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=https://kris-brown.github.io/>Home</a></li><li><a href=https://twitter.com/ksb_id>Twitter</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/kris-brown>Github</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
