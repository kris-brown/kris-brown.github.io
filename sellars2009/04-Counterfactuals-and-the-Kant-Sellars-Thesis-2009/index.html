notation, which takes some time to learn.</p><p><a href=../../people/Nelson-Goodman/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Nelson-Goodman/>Goodman</a> has let the formalism of classical
extensional logic mislead him in
thinking about counterfactuals. He thought we could build up to counterfactuals
from extensional logical vocabulary. The kind that can be built up by
extensional logical vocabulary Sellars calls subjunctive identicals.</p><p>Goodman is impressed in
<a href=../../works/Fact-Fiction-and-Forecast/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../works/Fact-Fiction-and-Forecast/>Fact, Fiction, and Forecast</a>, with
the difference between the claim &lsquo;All copper melts at 1084 °C&rsquo; and &lsquo;all the
coins in my pocket are copper&rsquo;. The first supports counterfactual reasoning
(&ldquo;if this coin in my pocket <em>were</em> copper, it&rsquo;d melt at 1084 °C&rdquo;) whereas if
this nickel coin were in my pocket, it wouldn&rsquo;t be made of copper. However we
can do some limited form of counterfactual reasoning: &ldquo;if I pulled a coin out
of my pocket, it would be copper&rdquo;. We can always rephrase such counterfactuals
(accidental generalizations) as a statement about something identical to an
actual object. (The distinction is less sharp between genuine counterfactuals
and subjunctive identicals is less sharp than he thinks, according to Brandom).</p><p>Sellars makes the distinction of
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../Subjunctive%20vs%20counterfactual%20conditionals>subjunctive vs counterfactual conditionals</a>.</p><a href=#dispositions><h1 id=dispositions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dispositions</h1></a><p>Sellars&rsquo; formalization of a disposition:</p><ol><li>A kind term<ul><li>More than a mere predicate: in addition to criteria of application, also
have criteria of identity and individuation.</li><li>Two flavors: proper individuating terms as well as mass terms (which
requires something like &lsquo;cup of&rsquo; to individuate)</li></ul></li><li>Condition term</li><li>Intervention term</li><li>Result term</li></ol><p>Canonical example: &ldquo;If you put the sugar in water, it will dissolve.&rdquo;</p><p>Distinct from a capacity claim: &ldquo;Sugar has the capacity to dissolve&rdquo; is a claim
that there exists a condition and intervention such that the result obtain.</p><a href=#casual-modalities><h1 id=casual-modalities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Casual modalities</h1></a><p>Sellars first big idea: what was needed was a functional theory of concepts
(especially alethic/normative modalities), which would make their role in
reasoning, rather than their supposed origin and experience their primary
feature. Sellars takes modal expressions to be inference licenses.</p><p>Jerry Fodor&rsquo;s theory of semantic content in terms of nomological locking: can&rsquo;t
directly say anything about modality directly. Not alone: Dretske and other
teleosemantic literature. Sellars wants to argue this program will never work.</p><p>An axial idea of
<a href=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/>Immanuel Kant</a>: the framework that
makes description possible has features which we can express with words (words
whose job is not to describe <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> anything, but rather to make explicit features
of the framework within which we can describe things).</p><p>The framework is often characterized with laws. With alethic modal vocabulary on
the object side, normative vocabulary on the subject side.</p><p><a href=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/>Immanuel Kant</a> is concerned with features that are
necessary conditions of the possibility of applying descriptive contents. How
are statements like that sensibly thought of as true or false? (where the home
language game is ordinary descriptive language) Kant says yes, in a sense, but
have to be careful. If these kinds of claims are knowledge, what kind of
justification is involved in it? Can we think of them as expressing even a kind
of empirical knowledge? (after all, we learned laws of nature empirically, it
seems). We have to think about the relationship between the framework and what
you can say, in the framework, and what you can say about the framework. Kant
was the first one worried about all that stuff. Sellars wants to find a meta
framework for talking about the relations between talk within that framework of
description, and talk about that framework of description.</p><a href=#from-labels-to-descriptions><h1 id=from-labels-to-descriptions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>From labels to descriptions</h1></a><p><a href=../../Semantic-nominalism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Semantic-nominalism/>Semantic nominalism</a> was universally held until Kant. (philosophy today hasn&rsquo;t
yet graduated from its Humean to its Kantian phase)</p><p>If you could argue that standing in counterfactually, robust inferential
relations to other descriptive terms, was an essential feature of the
descriptive content of a concept (and you could argue that modal vocabularies
had the expressive job of making those explicit), then you&rsquo;d be in a position
to argue for the Kant-Sellars thesis about modality. That would be to say that
the expressive job of modal vocabulary is to make explicit the inferential
relations between descriptive concepts (these are invisible to the empiricist).</p><p>Fork in road: Hume+Quine, or Kant+Sellars.</p><p>Labels are not descriptions. There&rsquo;s more to describing than labeling.</p><p>Consider mere labels. Elements on a tray have red or blue dots. Have they been
described? If so, what have they been described as? If we add things to the
tray, we don&rsquo;t know whether they deserve red or blue labels. At the very least,
descriptions need a practice for applying to new cases. We can throw that in but
still not have a description.</p><p>Suppose I&rsquo;m trying to give you the concept of gleeb. I give you an infalliable
gleebness tester. Do you have a description?</p><p><a href=../../people/Wilfrid-Sellars/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Wilfrid-Sellars/>Author</a></p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s only because the expressions in terms of which we describe
objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it
all rather than merely label.</p></blockquote><p>—

But it&rsquo;s more than
classifying things.</li><li>Sellars is raising the issue &ldquo;what is description?&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Sellars says &ldquo;concepts as classifiers&rdquo; is
<a href=../../Concepts-and-judgment/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Concepts-and-judgment/>not enough</a> to get to descriptions.</p><p>This is what a mere classifier does.</p><p>What&rsquo;s the difference between me and a parrot who has been trained to say &lsquo;red&rsquo;
when presented a red object. The parrot isn&rsquo;t describing, but I am because my
noise is situated in a space of implications: something follows for me from
classifying that thing is red (that it&rsquo;s colored that it&rsquo;s spatially extended,
that if it&rsquo;s a Macintosh Apple, it&rsquo;s right). And furthermore, other things can
be evidence for the claim that it Scarlet is evidence for it or that it&rsquo;s a
right Macintosh, Apple is evidence for it. And it excludes other
classifications. That monochromatic patch is not green, if it&rsquo;s red, and so on.</p><p>The classifier focuses only on the <em>circumstances</em> of application, not the
<em>consequences</em> of application. A way to answer what the red and blue dots
describe an element <em>as</em> is to say what follows from something having a blue or
red dot (e.g. things labelled red are to be discarded). Now we have some
descriptive content associated with the label.</p><p>Verificationism / classical American pragmatism focused purely on the
<em>consequences</em> of application.</p><p>To say we need both circumstances and consequences is to say that the inferences
the concept plays into is an essential part of a concept.</p><p>If the only inferences we could make were truth functional relations, then a
gleeb detector like thing could be sufficient to capture the concept of gleeb
fully; however, we care about counterfactually robust inferences.</p><p>You can&rsquo;t count as understanding (i.e. grasp the meaning of) any descriptive
expression / concept, unless you distinguish at least some of the inferences
that it&rsquo;s involved (i.e. some of the connections within that space of
implications) as counterfactually robust (i.e. ones that would still obtain,
even if something that is true wasn&rsquo;t, or something that isn&rsquo;t true was). The
claim is not that there are particular counterfactual inferences you need, but
that you need at least <em>some</em> to have the concept.</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>Chestnut trees produce chestnuts<ul><li>Unless they&rsquo;re immature / blighted</li><li>Whether or not it&rsquo;s raining on them now wouldn&rsquo;t affect the fact that
chestnut trees produce chestnuts</li></ul></li><li>Dry, well-made matches light if you strike them<ul><li>Not if there&rsquo;s not enough oxygen</li><li>The position of a distant beetle on a tree that doesn&rsquo;t affect whether
this match lights</li></ul></li><li>The hungry lioness would chase the nearby Gazelle<ul><li>Not if it were struck by lightning</li><li>But it would, whether or not the hyena were watching it</li></ul></li></ul><p>Q: do we have to have overlap in our distinctions we made to communicate about
the same concept?</p><p>A: The conceptual content itself is a norm that settles which inferences are
correct and which are incorrect. Then, you and I may have different views about
where that line is drawn. And what makes it possible for us to communicate (to
agree or to disagree) is that we&rsquo;ve bound ourselves by the same norm by using
the same word. You may think the melting point of copper is different from what
I think it is. But we can still be disagreeing about copper because there&rsquo;s a
fact of the matter about what you&rsquo;re committed to, on that issue, when you use
the word &lsquo;copper&rsquo;.</p><p>Q: Is this a counter-example? You are asked to bring a thing to your lab (it
just landed from an alien planet - you can&rsquo;t make any inferences about it).</p><p>A: It&rsquo;s complicated. Firstly, &rsquo;thing&rsquo; or &lsquo;object&rsquo; is not a sortal - you can&rsquo;t
count them (they&rsquo;re pro-sortals, placeholders for sortals). If we supply one
(e.g. place-occupying piece of mass - which would suffice give us some
counterfactually robust inferences). If you don&rsquo;t supply one, you haven&rsquo;t
thought about it. Related to Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
<a href=../../Pointing-at-a-plate/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Pointing-at-a-plate/>plate example</a>.</p><p><a href=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Immanuel-Kant/>Immanuel Kant</a> says concepts are rules for judgment we
<a href=../../people/Robert-Brandom/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Robert-Brandom/>bind ourselves by</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t settle the question of how much of the law we need to know in order to bind ourselves by it. I don&rsquo;t have to know much about molybdenum to refer to molybdenum.</p><a href=#semantic-nominalism><h1 id=semantic-nominalism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Semantic nominalism</h1></a><p>Semantic paradigm is the &ldquo;name-bearer&rdquo; relationship. E.g. the &lsquo;Fido&rsquo;-Fido
relation, between the name &lsquo;Fido&rsquo; and the dog, Fido. Predicates/properties are
just names that stick to the set.</p><p>If we stick together labels, we get descriptions (not a primitive name bearer
relation, but one we can understand in terms of name-bearer relations). That&rsquo;s
what language lets us do. Describe/classify things (as falling under languages).</p><p>Sellars calls this
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../Descriptivism>descriptivism</a>: what you do with language is describe things.</p><p>You find this not only in anglophone tradition but also in a pure form in
Hussurl / semiotics.
<a href=../../people/Jaques-Derrida/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Jaques-Derrida/>Derrida</a> rejects Hussurl because there are
some phenomena that can&rsquo;t be related by sign-signified relations, but he
addresses it by saying it&rsquo;s all signs.</p><p>Kant found sentences special: you don&rsquo;t describe things with them, you say

inferences are essential to articulating the content of ordinary empirical
descriptive concepts, then you&rsquo;d have an argument to the effect that the
capacity to use modal concepts what modal concepts make explicit is implicit
already in the use even of ordinary empirical, descriptive, non modal concepts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s explicit in

modal vocabulary anyone already knows how to do everything they need to know

teach you how to use modal vocabulary. You may not have a word for it yet.
That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll give you. But you already know how to <em>do</em> everything you
need to know how to do to use that word to talk with &rsquo;necessity&rsquo;,

language.</p><p>That some inference is ok is something that is <em>conveyed</em> by a modal claim, but
it is not what is <em>said</em>. (Analogy: John <em>says/asserts/means</em> &ldquo;The weather is
good today&rdquo;, but John <em>conveys</em> &ldquo;John thinks the weather is good today&rdquo; and John
<em>does not say</em> &ldquo;John thinks the weather is good today.&rdquo;). Related to this

assertion is endorsing a pattern of material inference. No need to take a stand
on semantics. This is an expressivist view of modal vocabulary. Analogous to
expressivism in ethics: what you are <em>doing</em> in saying someone ought to do $X$
is endorsing doing $X$. We can try to understand the semantic/descriptive
content\footnote{We cannot deny there is any descriptive content due to the
<a href=../../Frege-Geach-argument/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Frege-Geach-argument/>Frege-Geach argument</a> in terms of what one is <em>doing</em> when we use the expressions.)</p><a href=#what-makes-modal-claims-true><h1 id=what-makes-modal-claims-true><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>What makes modal claims true?</h1></a><p>Sellars wants to say it is the correctness of inferences connecting descriptive
terms that make modal claims. Simultaneously, modal claims do not <em>say</em> anything
about inferences.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important that notion of <em>saying</em> is wider than <em>describing</em>. This is the
denial of semantic descriptivism.</p><p>The pragmatic force associated with the modal claim is endorsing a pattern of
inference.</p><p>What one says is that being a $B$ follows from being an $A$. This is not a
statement <em>about</em> inferences, it is a statement about a consequential relation.
When one says &ldquo;$x$ being copper is incompatible with $x$ being an insulator&rdquo;,
one is making a claim about the world (even if it is not describing it in the
narrow sense). These are facts about what follows from what in the world. Given
the auxillary hypothesis that our word &lsquo;copper&rsquo; means <em>copper</em>, there are things
we can say about inferences, but the fact that we need that auxillary hypothesis
is proof that the statement itself isn&rsquo;t about inferences.</p><p>So modal claims are descriptive in the wide sense but not the narrow sense.</p><p>There are some serious concerns, though. Consider &ldquo;There exist causal
connections which have not yet been discovered&rdquo;. This is analogous to accepting
the early emotivist line in ethics (thinking &lsquo;ought&rsquo; is a perfectly good concept,
though not a descriptive one &mldr; such that &lsquo;Everybody ought to keep promises&rsquo;
contextually implies a wish, on the speaker&rsquo;s part, that promise keeping were a
universal practice), and was then confronted with such statements as &ldquo;There are
obligations which have not yet been recognized&rdquo; and &ldquo;Some of the things we think
of as obligations are not obligations&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p>It is therefore important to realize that the presence in the object language
of the causal modalities (and of the logical modalities and of the deontic
modalities) serves not only to express existing commitments, but also to provide
the framework for the thinking by which we reason our way (in a manner
appropriate to the specific subject matter) into the making of new commitments
and the abandoning of old. And since this framework essentially involves
quantification over predicate variables, puzzles over the &rsquo;existence of
abstract entities&rsquo; are almost as responsible for the prevalence in the
empiricist tradition of &rsquo;nothing-but-ism&rsquo; in its various forms (emotivism,
philosophical behaviorism, phenomenalism) as its tendency to assimilate all
discourse to describing.</p></blockquote><p>If we are to take causal modalities, seriously / at face value, we&rsquo;re going to
have to worry about what abstract objects and what properties are.</p><p>Brandom thinks Sellars could have a simpler/more satisfying conclusion to the
essay, but Sellars&rsquo; nominalism (denial of existence for abstract
objects/properties) prevents him from doing so.</p><p>In Brandom&rsquo;s view,
<a href=../../Material-inference-vs-logical-inference/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Material-inference-vs-logical-inference/>material inferences</a> are
<a href=../../Nonmonotonic-logic/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../Nonmonotonic-logic/>not monotonic</a>. The job of some
scientific languages is to find concepts where we can state monotonic
consequence relations. We can do that in fundamental physics, but hardly ever
in the special sciences.</p><a href=#relation-to-hegel><h1 id=relation-to-hegel><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Relation to Hegel</h1></a><p><a href=../../people/Georg-Wilhelm-Friedrich-Hegel/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Georg-Wilhelm-Friedrich-Hegel/>Hegel</a> says, &ldquo;By conceptual, I mean, what&rsquo;s articulated by relations of

as it is, independently of our activities, is conceptually articulated. It has
a conceptual structure because he&rsquo;s a modal realist about it.</p><p>He thinks there are laws of nature. He thinks some things really follow from
other things. For instance, that if a body with finite mass is accelerated, then
a force was applied to it. he thinks that&rsquo;s a consequence, and the remaining
relatively at rest, and having a force supplied you those are incompatible.
Those are incompatible properties.</p><p>So he says, the objective world has a conceptual structure already that has
nothing to do with our conceiving activity. We can see that as something else.
Yes, our commitments can also stand in relations of material consequence and in
compatibility, but the world, just as it comes, is already in conceptual shape.</p><a href=#utility-of-possible-worlds-semantics><h1 id=utility-of-possible-worlds-semantics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Utility of possible worlds semantics</h1></a><p>Let &lsquo;possible world&rsquo; <em>mean</em> a physically possible world <sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>.

properties to be incompatible or to stand in a material consequential relation.</p><p>So we can express (in the language of possible worlds) the fact that it follows

misusing possible world semantics. He
discards the connection between inference and the possible worlds. He takes the
descriptivist position that all one can do is describe with language, but then
says he is not an actualist (you can describe non-actual worlds in the same
sense that you can describe the coin in your pocket as copper).</p><p>What is lost by merging description in the narrow sense and description in the
wide sense? The connection to semantics. We&rsquo;ve also gained an additional problem
