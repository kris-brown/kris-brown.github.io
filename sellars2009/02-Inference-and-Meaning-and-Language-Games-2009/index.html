which sentences are &ldquo;logically-valid&rdquo; sentences. This could be generalized to
give us a notion of other types of vocabularies. E.g. we identify <em>theological</em>
vocabulary (e.g. <em>God</em>, <em>pious</em>) and observe which good inferences (e.g.
&ldquo;<em>If God loves</em> fishing, <em>then</em> fishing <em>is pious</em>&rdquo;) cannot
be made into bad inferences by substituting non-theological vocabulary, i.e.
sentences which are true purely due to their theological form.</p><a href=#sellars-has-two-good-ideas-associated-with-material-inference><h2 id=sellars-has-two-good-ideas-associated-with-material-inference><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sellars has two good ideas associated with material inference:</h2></a><ol><li>There <em>are</em> some inferences that are good, not in virtue of their logical form.</li><li>Turn the above thought on its head and say: we can understand the content of
these descriptive terms in terms of the materially good inferences they
appear in (as premises or conclusions).</li></ol><p>By this account, material proprieties of inference are more fundamental than /
conceptually prior to logical validity. You have to start with the notion of a
good inference in order to understand what a logically good inference is.</p><a href=#aside-on-the-philosophy-of-logic><h1 id=aside-on-the-philosophy-of-logic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Aside on the philosophy of logic</h1></a><p>Aside: It took a while in the 20th century to realize that logic was not about
logical truth but rather about validity of inference. In classical logic can
you treat these interchangably, but not all (rough logics vs smooth logics -
whether the consequence relation can be determined by the set of all theorems).
<a href=/people/Michael-Dummett/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/people/Michael-Dummett/>Dummett</a> has written about this issue.</p><p>What if we picked some other vocabulary (other than logical) to hold fixed? E.g.
substituting non-theological vocabulary for non-theological vocabulary.
&ldquo;If justice is loved by the gods then justice is pious&rdquo;. If no matter what we
substitute for justice the inference is good, we might say the sentence is true
in virtue of its theological form.</p><p>Philosophy of logic (See Quine&rsquo;s and Putnam&rsquo;s books both titled <em>The Philosophy
of Logic</em>) has two classic questions:</p><ol><li>a <em>demarcation</em> question: what makes something logical vocabulary?<ul><li>Quine disallows second order quantifiers and the epilson of set
theory, whereas Putnam allows them.</li></ul></li><li>a <em>correctness</em> question: which logical consequence relation to use:<ul><li>Classical? Intuitionistic? etc.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Sellars challenges this tradition (logical empiricism) by pointing out there is
a concern conceptually prior in the order of explanation to philosophy of
logic: materially good inferences.</p><a href=#inference-and-meaning><h1 id=inference-and-meaning><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Inference and Meaning</h1></a><ul><li><p>A main argument of <em>Inference and Meaning</em> is that any language that makes
essential use of non-logical, descriptive vocabulary must be understood as
having that vocabulary standing in materially good (rather than just logically
good) inferences.</p></li><li><p>A slogan for this: &ldquo;Concepts as involving laws (and inconceivable without them)&rdquo;</p><ul><li>This is actually the title of an unintelligible essay by Sellars</li><li>Luckily the title is the thesis, and that much is intelligible</li></ul></li><li><p>Sellars claims logical vocabulary has the expressive job of making explicit the
material proprieties of inference that articulate the content of non-logical
concepts.</p></li><li><p>More specifically than &rsquo;logical&rsquo;, he means <em>alethic modal</em> vocabulary: i.e.
what&rsquo;s <em>necessary</em> and what&rsquo;s <em>possible</em>.</p></li><li><p>Historical note: Frege is more explicit about this point than Sellars: that
you can use this to distinguish logical vocabulary.</p></li><li><p>The
<a href=/Montaignes-dog/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Montaignes-dog/>Montaigne example</a> highlights
the difference between the capacity to use material inferences vs making that
inference explicit:</p><ul><li>Dan Dennett argues that we have to take animals as grasping modus ponens
because they treat some inferences as good and others as bad</li><li>Sellars objects, saying that you <em>could</em> make explicit the practical
capacity the animal has via a statement of disjunctive syllogism</li><li>But what is the surplus value of invoking that explicit expression? (Over
simply describing what is the dog can do).</li></ul></li><li><p>Talking about following rules very quickly gets into the
<a href=/Regress-of-rules/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Regress-of-rules/>regress of rules</a>.</p><ul><li>There have to be some practical moves you&rsquo;re just allowed to make without
them having to take the form of explicit premises (see
<a href=/works/What-the-Tortoise-said-to-Achilles/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/works/What-the-Tortoise-said-to-Achilles/>What the Tortoise said to Achilles</a>.</li><li>Sellars touches upon this in
<a href=/works/Some-reflections-on-language-games/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/works/Some-reflections-on-language-games/>Some reflections on language games</a>.<ul><li>He talks about free/auxillary positions that you&rsquo;re always allowed to
occupy.</li><li>We could have the auxillary position $\forall x, \psi(x)\vdash \phi(x)$
which would license us to move from a position $\psi(a)$ to a position
$\phi(a)$, but we could also encode this with position for each possible
move ($\psi(a)\vdash \phi(a)$, $\psi(b)\vdash\phi(b)$, &mldr;).</li><li>He ways that we could imagine replacing positions with moves, but it&rsquo;s
not possible to imagine all moves being replaced with positions (&lsquo;a
game without moves is Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark&rsquo;).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>Sellars is addressing tradition that wants some small set of explicit
principles in accordance with which to reason. Any inference you think is good
that isn&rsquo;t derivable from that small set of principles (e.g. modus ponens) is
actually an infamy (has some suppressed premises). This is early analytic
philosophy&rsquo;s embrace of the new logic. Sellar&rsquo;s contrary view (radical at the
time) is that actually the reasoning could be completely in order, just with
material proprieties of reasoning. You can still give/ask for reasons and mean
that $p$, but what the logic does is give you meta-linguistic control to talk
about what is a good inference and say that $p \vdash q$ is a good
inference.<sup id=fnref1:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p></li><li><p>Example: $A\vdash B$ where $A$ is &ldquo;she asked me to hand her the dish towel&rdquo;
and $B$ is &ldquo;I shall hand her the dish towel&rdquo;. Traditional analytic philosophy
will call this an infamy, since it does not explicitly state how her request
engages my motivational structure. Sellars would want to say that this
invocation of the desire makes explicit the endorsement of $A \vdash B$ rather
than referring to some item of the world.</p></li><li><p>Brandom: logic is the organ of semantic self-consciousness. The set of
concepts that lets us bring our endorsement of some inferences as good/bad
(this endorsement as something that reasons can be given or asked for) into
the game of giving/asking for reasons.</p></li><li><p>Sellars complains about Carnap treating logical consequence as a syntactically
definable relation between sentences. Just writing down the rules under a
heading &lsquo;rules&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;axioms&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t making explicit the normative force
they have (it leaves out the rulishness - that a rule is a rule for <em>doing</em>
something). This is a subtle point that doesn&rsquo;t matter for many purposes, but
Sellars believes it&rsquo;s important if you want to understand what&rsquo;s going on with
reasoning. Again, strong connection between this point and <em>Achilles and the
Tortoise</em>.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an important difference between logical / modal / normative
predicates on the one hand, and such predicates as &lsquo;red&rsquo; on the other.&rdquo;
There&rsquo;s nothing to the formal except their role in reasoning, indeed, their
role and make as meta linguistics sort of making explicit something about the
ground level. For the latter, he wants to argue that these predicates too are
meaningful insofar as their role in reasoning, but it&rsquo;s less obvious.</p></li><li><p>&ldquo;Red is a quality&rdquo;. This conveys the same information as the syntactical
sentence &ldquo;<em>Red</em> is a one place predicate.&rdquo; See
<a href=/quotes/Transposed-language-of-norms/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/quotes/Transposed-language-of-norms/>quote</a>. What you&rsquo;re <em>doing</em> in asserting
that premise from which to reason (couched in modal vocabulary) is endorsing a
principle in accordance with which to reason (couched in normative vocabulary).</p></li><li><p>We cannot completely identify modal and normative statements with each other.
Their relation is characterized by the say/convey distinction.</p></li></ul><a href=#sayconvey-distinction><h2 id=sayconvey-distinction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Say/convey distinction</h2></a><p>When I say &ldquo;copper melts at 1084 degrees&rdquo; one makes a claim that is true even if
there were no reasoners (so it can&rsquo;t be a claim directly <em>about</em> inferences
being good). What it <em>conveys</em> is about inferences, not what it <em>says</em>.
Likewise, I say &ldquo;The sun is shining&rdquo; while I convey &ldquo;I believe the sun is
shining.&rdquo;</p><p>It might help to make progress toward understanding the say/convey distinction
(which Sellars admits he&rsquo;s not clear about) by distinguishing two flavors of
inference:</p><ol><li>semantic inference: good in virtue of the contents of the premises and the
conclusion</li><li>pragmatic inference: good in virtue of what you&rsquo;re doing in asserting the

making explicit proprieties of inference, but in fact are descriptions about
possible worlds. To address this, we note there are separate issues.</p><p>Firstly, there&rsquo;s the question about whether it&rsquo;s intelligible to have
descriptive vocabulary in play in a context where there&rsquo;s no counterfactual
reasoning. E.g. Hume believes he understands empirical facts perfectly well (the
cat is on the mat) but not statements about what&rsquo;s possible and necessary. But
Kant saw that this isn&rsquo;t intelligible - you need to make a distinction about
what&rsquo;s possible with the cat and what&rsquo;s not (it&rsquo;s possible for the cat to not be
on the mat, but not possible for it to be larger than the sun) or else there&rsquo;s
nothing you could say about the content of the concept of &lsquo;cat&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ve got (
it would be just a label).</p><p>The second issue is the codifiability of proprieties of material inference by
logical vocabulary: whether a possible worlds analysis is incompatible with
seeing subjunctive conditionals as making properties of inference explicit.
Sellars would like to see a possible worlds analysis that matches up.</p><a href=#some-reflections-on-language-games><h1 id=some-reflections-on-language-games><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Some Reflections on Language Games</h1></a><p>Regulism (conceptual norms as a matter of explicit rules) vs regularism (norms
in terms of actual regularities). These are identified with empiricist and
rationalist approaches.</p><p>One purpose: &ldquo;I shall have a chief my present purpose if I&rsquo;ve made plausible the
idea that an organism might come to play a language game, that is to move from
position to position, the system of moves and positions, and to do it because of
the system without having to obey rules, and hence without having to be playing
a meta language game.&rsquo;&rsquo; (Section 18)</p><p>He doesn&rsquo;t explicitly mention Wittgenstein (who is a pariah in philosophy).
(Other times he uses astrices to censor his name). Thinking about language in
terms of rules is Kantian. His notion of norms was juridical/jurisprudential. A
rule that enjoins the doing of an action A is a sentence in some language, which
requires more rules to interpret (regress - how do we deal with it?). Kant
identified this regress (A132/B171) - &ldquo;judgment is a peculiar talent that can be
practiced only and not taught&rsquo;&rsquo;. Which is using distinction between things that
can be shown (by examples) vs taught. Wittgenstein addresses this regress in the
late 100&rsquo;s of PI.</p><p>Rejecting mere conformity: If we just consider conforming to a rule rather than
obeying a rule, there&rsquo;s no regress, but we lose the normativity.</p><p>&ldquo;[Mere conformity people] claim that it&rsquo;s raining therefore the streets will be
wet (when it isn&rsquo;t an infamatic abridgement of a formally valid argument) is
merely the manifestation of a tendency to expect to see the wet streets when one
finds it&rsquo;s raining. In this latter case, it&rsquo;s a manifestation of a process which
at best can only simulate inference, since it&rsquo;s a habitual transition, and as
such not governed by a principle or rule by reference to which can be
characterized as valid or invalid. That Hume dignified the activation of an
association with the phrase &lsquo;causal inference&rsquo; is about a minor flaw, they
continue, in an otherwise brilliant analysis. It should, however, be immediately
pointed out that before one has a right to say that what Hume calls &lsquo;causal
inference&rsquo; really is an inference at all, but merely a habitual transition from
one thought to another. And contrast that with in this context, the genuine
logical inferences which are, one must pay the price of showing just how logical
inference is something more than a mere habitual transition empiricists in the
human tradition have rarely paid this price, a fact which is proved most
unfortunate for the following reason. An examination of the history of the
subject shows that those who have held that causal inference only simulates
inference proper have been led to do so as a result of the conviction that if
it were a genuine inference, the laws of nature, things that govern this would
be discovered to us by pure reason. As they&rsquo;re thinking of what&rsquo;s a good
inference having to be something that&rsquo;s transparent merely by introspection in
the way that the laws of logic are.&rsquo;&rsquo; (him making point about distinction of r
eal inferences and mere associations. )</p><p>No distinction between correct and incorrect can be made by purely pointing to
regularity - as Wittgenstein pointed out, you&rsquo;ll always find some regularity
(there&rsquo;s some elegant rule that generates the sequence, for any arbitrary
sequence). This is also called &lsquo;
<a href=/Disjunctivitis/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Disjunctivitis/>disjunctivitis</a>&rsquo; or &lsquo;gerrymandering&rsquo; objections.</p><p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s denied is the playing a game logically involves obedience to the rules
of the game. And hence the ability to use the language to play the language game
in which the rules are formulated.&rsquo;&rsquo; (page 29) Need a sense of playing the game
stronger than conforming but weaker than having the rules in mind.</p><p>Metaphysicus suggests why not a non-linguistic awareness of the rules? This is
its own regress.</p><blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve tacitly accepted so far and the dialectic dichotomy between merely
conforming to the rules and obey. But surely this is a false dichotomy. Is there
something in between, for it required us to suppose that the only way in which a
complex system of activity can be involved in the explanation of the occurrence
of a particular act is by the agent explicitly envisaging the system and
intending its realization. And that&rsquo;s as much as to say that unless the agent
conceives of the system, the conformity of his behavior to the system must be
accidental.</p></blockquote><ul><li>So what&rsquo;s needed he&rsquo;s saying, is going to be something that says, look,
there&rsquo;s an explanation of why he conforms to the rules. That invokes the
rules, but it doesn&rsquo;t invoke them by him being aware of them. One example of
this is teleosemantics. See
<a href=/Bee-Waggle/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Bee-Waggle/>Bee Waggle</a>.</li></ul><p>The essential thing for Kant was a distinction between what was between acting
according to a rule and acting according to a conception of a rule, or a
representation (Vorstellung) of a rule. So, ordinary natural objects act
according to rules, the laws of nature, but we act according to representations
of rules / to conceptions of rules.</p><p>The explanation as to why I use the word &lsquo;purple&rsquo; for purple things, the rule
plays a crucial part even if it is not in my head. It is in the teachers&rsquo; heads
(they&rsquo;re already in the language and can conceive of rules). So the rule is
causally antecedent to my behavior, so I can be following the rule (without
regress).</p><p>Related quesiton addressed here:
<a href=/Behaviorism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Behaviorism/>classical behaviorism</a>.</p><p>How is it that I can apply a concept according to norms, to invoke a
pre-linguistic awareness of universals, that&rsquo;s going to be a given. And the key
thing is, because that pre-linguistic awareness is conceived of as providing
<em>reasons</em> for me to do this. It&rsquo;s not just that I&rsquo;ve been <em>trained</em> to respond
to some physiological thing by doing it (that would be okay. That could be part
of the the real explanation, the pattern governed explanation). It&rsquo;s that that
pre-linguistic awareness provides reasons. And the claim is reasons are always
making a move in a game that&rsquo;s making the inferential move. And the question is:
what determines the norms that govern that? Then we&rsquo;re off on the on the regress,
again, so we&rsquo;ve got to have some story that doesn&rsquo;t have that form. The form of
the argument against the myth of the given. It&rsquo;s the idea that the awareness
that givenness provides something that can serve as a reason, but is itself not
dependent on our having learned a language, having a conceptual scheme, and so
on.</p><p>To do: understand language entry transitions and language exit transitions.</p><p>There is debate (but it should be more of a bigger deal, in Brandom&rsquo;s opinion)
about what are the minimal features needed for one to have a discursive language
practice. Brandom views logical language as optional (though the expressive
power would be incredibly stunted, you could still give and ask for reasons).
MacDowell and Sellars think otherwise, that there can&rsquo;t be discourse without a
meta-language.</p><p>Sellars needs the notion of language to be something that evolves over time
(rather than an instantaneous collection of rules) because we want the decision
to make a material move to occur within a language (one is not doing
redescription in another language).</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Letters (e.g. $P$, $Q$, $X$) represent logical variables. These have the
