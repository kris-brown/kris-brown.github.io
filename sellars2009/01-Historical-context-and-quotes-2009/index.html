analytic philosophers (who largely preferred to write &lsquo;gem-like&rsquo; articles).<ul><li>This makes it also hard to read Sellars - it&rsquo;s hard to get a hold of one piece
of it without getting the whole.</li></ul></li><li>Sellars had an almost unique knowledge of and appreciation for the significance of the <em>history</em> of philosophy<ul><li>(not just a subdiscipline, but rather as the language in which philosophy is pursued).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></li></ul></li><li>Sellars&rsquo; overall aim was to move analytic philosophy from its Humean phase to its Kantian phase.<ul><li>Epitomizes his views towards empiricism/naturalism (which had characterized
analytic philosophy).</li><li>That Kant was worth respecting a radical view at the time - he had been
written out of the canon due to his connection to
<a href=../../people/Georg-Wilhelm-Friedrich-Hegel/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Georg-Wilhelm-Friedrich-Hegel/>Hegel</a>.[^1]</li><li>Rawls on the theoretical side and Strawson/Bennett on the practical side
brough Kant back into respectability in Anglophone circles, but Sellars was
way out in front of this (and appreciated the significance of Kant deeper).</li><li>This is also why Sellars wasn&rsquo;t so influential - people didn&rsquo;t understand
the Kant needed to appreciate him.</li></ul></li></ul><a href=#kants-influence-on-sellars><h2 id=kants-influence-on-sellars><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Kant&rsquo;s influence on Sellars</h2></a><p>Kant&rsquo;s big idea:</p><p>What is sapience? (what distinguishes <em>knowers</em> and mere responders to an environment?)</p><ul><li>It&rsquo;s not some presence of &ldquo;mind-stuff&rdquo; (i.e. Cartesian dualism)</li><li>It&rsquo;s that judgments and intentional doings are things that knowers and agents
are in a distinctive sense <em>responsible for</em>.</li><li>Judgments express commitments of those subjects / their exercises of authority</li><li>The difference between mind minded things and unminded and things isn&rsquo;t an ontological one, but a <em>de</em>ontological one.</li></ul><p><em>Judgment</em> is important for Kant</p><ul><li>it is the minimal thing that we can
be held accountable for (the smallest unit of consciousness)</li><li>The form of the judgment has two parts:<ul><li>Subjective: the &ldquo;I think &mldr;&rdquo; that can accompany any judgment<ul><li><em>Who</em> is responsible</li></ul></li><li>Objective: &ldquo;object = x&rdquo;<ul><li>what you make yourself responsible <em>to</em> by taking the judgment</li><li>what you need to consult in order to determine the correctness</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Cartesian questions are about our grip on concepts. Thinking about concepts as
rules for making judgments, Kantian questions are about the concepts&rsquo; grip on us.</p><ul><li><p>A concept is the rule you bind yourself to by calling the coin &lsquo;copper&rsquo;. (You
commit yourself, whether you know it or not, to it&rsquo;s being an electrical
conductor, melting at a particular temperature, etc.).</p></li><li><p>Rather than a Cartesian mind-body problem, it&rsquo;s a norm-fact problem. The relationship
between prescription and description - that&rsquo;s what is special about <em>us</em>.</p></li></ul><p>Hegel took this Kantian question and observed that normative status are
socially instituted statuses - we have to look at social practices to understand
what responsibility / authority are. (this idea was reintroduced indepenently
by the later Wittgenstein - for example his
<a href=../../A-childrens-game/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../A-childrens-game/>children&rsquo;s game</a> investigates the
normative significance of beliefs/desires/intentions).</p><p>Sellars on what is philosophy: &ldquo;the attempt to say how things, in the largest
sense of that term, hang together, in the largest sense of that term.&rdquo;</p><a href=#core-programs-of-analytical-philosophy><h1 id=core-programs-of-analytical-philosophy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Core programs of analytical philosophy</h1></a><p>Analytic philosophy held together as being a <em>semantic</em> project.</p><ul><li>Understand the meanings of potentially-problematic target vocabularies in
terms of the meanings of putatively-unproblematic base vocabularies.<ul><li>Some debate over what the relation between target and base vocabularies
needs to be:<ul><li>definability</li><li>translatability</li><li>paraphrasability</li><li>&ldquo;analyzable in terms of&rdquo;</li><li>reducibility</li><li>supervenience</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Examples:<ul><li><em>On denoting</em>: problematic vocabulary is definite descriptions, translated
into the unproblematic vocabulary of FOL with identity.</li><li>Frege&rsquo;s problematic vocabulary was arithmatic statements, which were made
sense of in quantificational logic with identity.</li></ul></li><li>Things like intentional, normative, metaphysical vocabularies were typically
problematic.<ul><li>Core programs of empiricism and naturalism can be understood as having
different choice of base vocabularies<ul><li>Empiricism: base language is sensory experience (e.g. a language of sense
data, language of how things seem or appear)</li><li>Naturalism: language of natural science (possibly just fundamental
physics or broader)</li><li>The Vienna Circle was divided into two wings. Schlict (empiricist) and Neurath
(naturalist), and Carnap in between. Prime source of tension between them was
modality / lawlikeness.</li></ul></li><li><em>Functionalism</em>: Unproblematic vocabulary is talking about how something
plays a role in a larger system. (paradigmatically shows up in the
philosophy of mind.)<ul><li>Sellars was the first functionalist. broader than the sense that it
comes up in the philosophy of mind: Sellars is a <em>semantic</em> functionalist.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Another reason why Sellars is important is his distinctive views about
empiricism, naturalism, and functionalism.</p><a href=#role-of-logic><h2 id=role-of-logic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Role of logic</h2></a><p>Logic as developed in the early 20th century is a powerful tool for giving us
inferential control. Logical empiricists found this tool indispensible.
They viewed the early empiricists (e.g. Locke, Hume) as
having the right building blocks, but &ldquo;association&rdquo; was too weak of a mortar to
hold them together and build the edifice of knowledge of the objective world.
Although Sellars isn&rsquo;t a logical empiricist, he also found logic to be a useful
tool and can be thought of as a logical Kantian. After Kant, the nextmost
important philosopher for Sellars was Carnap. (despite Carnap&rsquo;s empiricism.)</p><a href=#summary-of-views><h1 id=summary-of-views><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary of views</h1></a><p>It is debated whether or not Sellars was an reductive naturalist, but Brandom does not
think so.</p><p><a href=../../people/Wilfrid-Sellars/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../people/Wilfrid-Sellars/>Author</a></p><blockquote><p>In characterizing an episode or a state as <em>knowing</em>, we are not giving an
empirical description of it. We are placing it in the logical space of reasons,
of justifying and being able to justify what one says.</p></blockquote><p>â€”

<a href=../../quotes/Scienta-mensura/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../quotes/Scienta-mensura/>Scienta mensura</a> quote - we have an example of something
(describing knowledge) as something that science is not the measure of all
things about.</p></li><li><p>This is a powerful weapon against empiricist reductionisms of all sorts,
according to Brandom.</p></li></ul><p>There is a Cartesian dualism threatening the tradition that Kant is overcoming.
Is Sellars replacing this with a norm-fact dualism?</p><p>What is a dualism? What a distinction becomes when it is drawn in such terms
that the relation between the distinguished terms becomes unintelligible.
Complaint about Cartesian dualism:</p><ul><li>if you&rsquo;re committed to &ldquo;mind stuff&rdquo; being non-extended.</li><li>and to the physical world being extended.</li><li>throw in some general claims about causation (e.g. it occurs in a place)</li><li>then perception and agency become unintelligble (how is the mind affected by real stuff / how can the mind cause something?)</li></ul><p>For norm fact distinction.</p><ul><li>Epistemological questions:<ul><li>How can we know about norm stuff? in the way we know about mass?</li><li>Does it causally affect us?</li></ul></li><li>Ontological questions:<ul><li>Where in the world of natural science do we find these things?</li></ul></li></ul><p>A reductive naturalist doesn&rsquo;t have to face this threat of a dualism. But one
loses the meaning.</p><a href=#a-kantian-idea-that-sellars-never-lost-sight-of-the-transcendental-move><h2 id=a-kantian-idea-that-sellars-never-lost-sight-of-the-transcendental-move><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>A Kantian idea that sellars never lost sight of: the transcendental move</h2></a><p>The conceptual framework that makes it possible to give matter-of-factual
descriptions of how things actually are - that framework has essential features
which can also be put into words - but those words will not be playing the role
of describing things how they are. For example: alethic modal vocabulary.</p><p>To <em>describe</em> things you have to commit yourself to inferential relations that are
counterfactually robust (otherwise you&rsquo;re merely labeling).</p><p>Hume thought he could understand what means for the cat to be on the mat but not
that it is impossible for the cat to be weightless or as big as the sun. Sellars
says that, unless you make <em>some</em> distinction about what is possible/necessary for cats
and what is not (note you don&rsquo;t have to get it <em>right</em>), you can&rsquo;t count as
applying the concept <em>cat</em> to describe something. So you can&rsquo;t be in the
predicament Hume thought he was in. The argument is seen in
<a href=../../works/Counterfactuals-Dispositions-and-the-Causal-Modalities/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../works/Counterfactuals-Dispositions-and-the-Causal-Modalities/>Counterfactuals, Dispositions, and the Causal Modalities</a>.</p><p>A &lsquo;master idea&rsquo; that Sellars never explicitly says at this level of generality:</p><p>every philosophically interesting/problematic vocabulary turns out metalinguistic:</p><ul><li>logical vocabulary:<ul><li>&ldquo;if &mldr; then &mldr;&rdquo; does not describe something in the world but makes explicit inferential commitments that articulate the contents of concepts that do (in the narrow sense) describe thing</li></ul></li><li>alethetic modal vocabulary<ul><li>Makes what you are doing with subjunctives explicit</li></ul></li><li>normative vocabulray</li><li>semantic vocabulary<ul><li>because it&rsquo;s true of normative and modal vocabulary</li></ul></li><li>intentional vocabulary<ul><li>because it&rsquo;s true of semantic vocabulary</li></ul></li><li>ontological vocabulary<ul><li>e.g. universals</li></ul></li></ul><p>His strategy for dealing with problematic vocabulary is to treat as metalinguistic.</p><p>His notion of metalinguistic isn&rsquo;t made explicit anywhere. It&rsquo;s more flexible
than for Carnap. One attempt at explaining it: what metalinguistic discourses
do is functionally classify bits of vocabulary. He thinks of it as transcendental
grammar.</p><p>Pragmatic dependencies make explicit conceptual dependencies.</p><ul><li>E.g. &ldquo;Looks $\phi$&rdquo; talk depends on &ldquo;Is $\phi$&rdquo; talk. (

to <em>describe</em> but rather to express attitudes (e.g. approval, disapproval). But
Geach showed that there exist <em>some</em> descriptive content due to the intelligibility
of &ldquo;If he ought to do X, then he has reason to do X&rdquo; (one is not expressing
approval of doing X).</p><a href=#conclusion><h1 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h1></a><p>Kant is a empirical realist, transcendental idealist. Sellars is an empirical
naturalist, but a trancendental non-naturalist. This gives Sellars his unique
perspective on the problems of philosophy.</p><ul><li>the empricial naturalism is epitomized by
<a href=../../quotes/Scienta-mensura/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=../../quotes/Scienta-mensura/>Scienta mensura</a> quote</li><li>the transcendental non-naturalism comes from the ineliminble expressive role

This surprised Brandom in his youthful innocence (how could you be unhappy when
you&rsquo;ve been so philosophically accomplished? just think about your accomplishments!).</p><ol><li>It&rsquo;s taken until Kant&rsquo;s death until now for anybody (i.e. Sellars) to figure out<br>what he was on about.

philosopher.</li><li>But that was the same year <em>Word and Object</em> came out. It was a tidal wave.</li><li>Only thing that interrupted that wave, if anything, in the next decade was
<em>Naming and Necessity</em>.</li><li>Sellars&rsquo; Locke lectures in 1963 were utterly disasterous. Sellars never
recovered from this. On his deathbed he said it was the worst experience of
his life.</li><li>He had the view, admirable but disasterous, to only deliver unfinished work
at seminars (let&rsquo;s work out these ideas together, I don&rsquo;t want to tell you
something that I have no chance of changing my mind about - that&rsquo;s what
written publishing is for).</li><li>At age 45 he was finally getting the respect he deserved and 9 years later
it was all over.</li></ul><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>This is one dimension along which the world spirit has caught up with
