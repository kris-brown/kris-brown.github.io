He then had a political kehre (had extended interactions with Habermas).</p><a href=#rortys-argument><h1 id=rortys-argument><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Rorty&rsquo;s argument</h1></a><p>Here are five claims or moves Rorty might be seen to be making:</p><ol><li>Rejecting two-stage talk of two activities, one of instituting meanings and the other of applying them to justify beliefs. <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></li><li>Rejecting the language/theory distinction entirely, in favor of the ‘vocabulary’ vocabulary. All we do is use vocabularies, and those practices both institute meanings and apply concepts to undertake commitments (endorse, take-true, some claimables).</li><li>Rejecting the Kantian problematic of assigning responsibility for some features of our discourse (vocabulary-use) to what we are talking about (what is represented)—the authority of the objective—and responsibility for other features of our discourse to us— the authority of the subjective.</li><li>Rejecting as ultimately unintelligible the idea that our thought is normatively constrained (as opposed to causally constrained) by an objective world via the representational semantic dependence of representings on representeds that consists in representeds providing normative standards of assessment of the correctness of representings (in a distinctive sense of “correctness.”). This is a kind of authority of representeds over representings.</li><li>Social pragmatism about normativity: all normative statuses (responsibility, authority, being a standard of correctness) are social statuses.</li></ol><a href=#rr-on-romanticism><h1 id=rr-on-romanticism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>RR on Romanticism</h1></a><p>Mediating between idealism and pragmatism.</p><p>Romanticism has idealist and pragmatist tendencies.

<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../quotes/Pragmatism%20and%20Nietzsche>redescription of Nietzsche</a>, an example of the kind of strong textualism which takes a text and beats it into a shape to suit the reader&rsquo;s purpose, imposing his own vocabulary on it.</p><p>Rorty
<a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../quotes/Hegel%20literary%20genre>reconstructs</a> a progression from <em>idealism</em> to <em>romanticism</em> to <em>pragmatism</em>.</p><p>Rorty makes a number of claims:</p><ol><li><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../quotes/Textualists%20and%20language%20relativity>all problems, topics, and distinctions are language-relative</a></li><li><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../quotes/Strong%20and%20weak%20textualists>criticizing any philosophical view that presupposes an objectively privileged vocabulary (simply in virtue of its relation to its subject matter)</a></li><li><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../quotes/Romanticism%20as%20vocabulary%20over%20truth>the vocabulary of science is merely one among others</a><ul><li>The privilege that science (controlling nature) has is not inherently privileged over other possible advantages other vocabularies have</li></ul></li><li>Romanticism defined as &ldquo;the one thing needful was to discover not which propositions are true but rather what vocabulary we should use.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>What&rsquo;s important about being human is our ability to self-transform, redescribe. Romanticism was important because of its focus on that capacity as the center of human aspiration, rather than getting things right representationally.</p><p>Rorty has a notion of a &ldquo;presiding cultural discipline&rdquo; - since the Enlightenment it has been science, but in the future it could be literature. Science was emancipatory at the start of the Enlightenment, but by the end of the 19th century it became constraining.</p><a href=#danger-backsliding-into-carnappian-pragmatism><h2 id=danger-backsliding-into-carnappian-pragmatism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Danger: backsliding into Carnappian pragmatism</h2></a><p>Rorty says that what the romantics discovered that we are free to pick our vocabulary.</p><p>Treating vocabularies as if they are languages that we are free to chose from is dangersouly close to Carnappian pragmatism.

<a href=/people/Jaques-Derrida/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/people/Jaques-Derrida/>Derrida</a> as &ldquo;weak textualism&rdquo; and sees it as backsliding into representationalist philosophy.</p><p><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../people/Richard%20Rorty>Author</a></p><blockquote><p>Occasionally a great physicist or a great critic comes along and gives us a new vocabulary which enables us to do a lot of new and marvelous things. Then we may exclaim that we have now found out the true nature of matter, or poetry, or whatever. But Hegel&rsquo;s ghost, embodied in Kuhn&rsquo;s romantic philosophy of science or Bloom&rsquo;s philosophy of romantic poetry, reminds us that vocabularies are as mortal as men. The pragmatist reminds us that a new and useful vocabulary is just that, not a sudden unmediated vision of things or texts as they are.</p><p>As usual with pithy little formulae, the Derridean claim that &ldquo;There is nothing outside the text&rdquo; is right about what it implicitly denies and wrong about what it explicitly asserts. The only force of saying that texts do not refer to non-texts is just the old pragmatist chestnut that any specification of a referent is going to be in some vocabulary. Thus one is really comparing to descriptions of a thing rather than a description with the thing-in-itself.</p><p>This chestnut, in turn, is just an expanded form of Kant&rsquo;s slogan that &ldquo;Intuitions without concepts are blind,&rdquo; which, in turn, was just a sophisticated restatement of Berkeley&rsquo;s ingenuous remark that &ldquo;nothing can be like an idea except an idea.&rdquo;</p><p>These are all merely misleading ways of saying that we shall not see reality plain, unmasked, naked to our gaze.</p><p>Textualism has nothing to add to this claim except a new misleading image—the image of the world as consisting of everything written in all the vocabularies used so far.

Textualism adds nothing save an extra metaphor to the romanticism of Hegel and the pragmatism of James and Nietzsche&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>—

Brandom: &ldquo;If we really understand structuralism (thinking of the functional roles of signifiers) we&rsquo;ll see that there is only the signifiers to worry about&rdquo;.</p><p>Brandom says this model is semantically inadequate as a model and not even a radical rejection of the signifier/signified model. He wants to file it away in a cabinet labeled &ldquo;How not to be an antirepresentationalist&rdquo;.</p><p>Pierce said similar things about interpretants and interpreters. His principal admirer Charles Morris used this notion of the name-bearer relation to found semiotics, which is not a successful field.</p><p>This is not just
<a href=/Representationalism/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/Representationalism/>representationalism</a>, it is nominalistic representationalism (Taking tha name-bearer relationship as the semantic paradigm).

One question we can ask: to what extent is the categorical-structure of the world a vocabulary-dependent phenomenon?</p><ul><li>Ask how we are to address debate two ways of thinking of the objective world we are talking about: is it (as wittgenstein puts it) a world of facts or a world of things?
Rorty thinks, if you say it&rsquo;s a world of facts, you&rsquo;ve conceded his antirepresentationalist point (because the notion of fact<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> is a vocabulary-relative).</li></ul><p>You might try to avoid this by thinking of a world of objects, but objects are equally vocabulary-dependent.

(e.g. the lawfulness of a relation between two properties is a feature of our cognitive faculties) it makes a big difference whether this is a sense or reference dependence claim.</p><ul><li>Without understanding what it is for you to follow a rule / to infer $B$ from $A$, you can&rsquo;t <em>understand</em> the lawfulness that you&rsquo;re taking the world to have.</li><li>This does not entail a reference dependence.</li></ul><p>We need to be careful when reading Rorty (who doesn&rsquo;t explicitly make this distinction) that we are not accepting his claims (as plausible because they are sense-dependence) and then letting him draw consequences from them (as if they were reference-dependence).</p><p>Brandom suggests that to understand the notion of a fact, one needs to understand the notion of a judgment (and vice-versa). Likewise, to understand the notion of an object and to understand the notion of a singular term in a language also must be understood together (two sides of one coin).</p><a href=#pragmatist-conceptual-progress><h1 id=pragmatist-conceptual-progress><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pragmatist conceptual progress</h1></a><p><a rel=noopener class="internal-link broken" data-src=../people/Richard%20Rorty>Author</a></p><blockquote><p>In the final sentence of his book, Putnam says that, &ldquo;The very fact that we speak of our different conceptions as different conceptions of rationality posits a Grenzbegriff, a limited-concept of ideal truth.&rdquo; But what is such a posit supposed to do, except to say that from God&rsquo;s point of view the human race is heading in the right direction?&mldr;</p><p>To say that we think we&rsquo;re heading in the right direction is just to say, with Kuhn, that we can, by hindsight, tell the story of the past as a story of progress. To say that we still have a long way to go, that our present views should not be cast in bronze, is too platitudinous to require support by positing limit-concepts. So it is hard to see what difference is made by the difference between saying &ldquo;there is only the dialogue&rdquo; and saying &ldquo;there is also that to which the dialogue converges.&rdquo;</p><p>Positing <em>Grenzbegriffe</em> seems merely a way of telling ourselves that a nonexistent God would, if he did exist, be pleased with us. If we could ever be moved solely by the desire for solidarity, setting aside the desire for objectivity altogether, then we should think of human progress as making it possible for human beings to do more interesting things and be more interesting people, not as heading toward a place that has somehow been prepared for humanity in advance. Our self-image would employ images of making rather than finding, the images used by the Romantics to praise poets rather than the images used by the Greeks to praise mathematicians.</p></blockquote><p>—

There&rsquo;s nothing outside the dialogue.</p><p>But we can imagine institutions of science being taken over by religious fanatics. They&rsquo;ll be able to make a retrospective story too. Rorty has to say &ldquo;We hope that this won&rsquo;t happen, but history is written by the victors.&rdquo;</p><p>Brandom challenges this and offers a pragmatist-sanitized notion of <em>pro</em>spective, technological progress.</p><ul><li>The new technology has to be able to do what we&rsquo;re already doing (better than we can).</li><li>This is evaluated in <em>our</em> current vocabulary.</li><li>This sorts future retrospective stories into good or bad from our perspective.</li></ul><p>This is what persuaded the conquering Arabs to keep Greek learning - they <em>knew</em> Greek medicine could save people from battlefield wounds that were otherwise surely fatal. When the Greek doctors said that to understand how, you needed to think about how the microcosm and the macrocosm were related, the Arabs had little choice but to think that all that Greek literature and philosophy must be valuable and should be preserved. Aristotle would not be able to appreciate how accurately we can measure the mass of the electron. But he would be impressed by our medicine, by our ability to blow large holes in the ground, move things rapidly over great distances, build large, stable structures&mldr;and so on.</p><p>The demand for technological conservation and progress, understood by prospective normative standards set by earlier practical attitudes and assessments puts a genuine constraint on what counts as theoretical progress, understood by retrospective normative standards set by later practical attitudes and assessments.</p><p>We could <em>define</em> technological progress as that which can be measured prospectively.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> Then we can make it a criterion of adequacy for a good &ldquo;retrospective story&rdquo; that it must be technologically progressive (in domains of the empirical world). We might not care, e.g. for poetic traditions, that we preserve prospective progress.</p><p>Brandom ties this to Pierce&rsquo;s theory of progress. What is prospectively assessible is a constraint on what is retrospectively assessible. This is a way to not be mere carnappian progress but see real friction between vocabularies in use (without thinking in representationalist terms).</p><a href=#pragmatist-version-of-kantian-problematic><h1 id=pragmatist-version-of-kantian-problematic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pragmatist version of Kantian problematic</h1></a><p>Brandom suggests that we can accept the vocabulary vocabulary without drawing Rorty&rsquo;s conclusion that we need to move beyond the Kantian problematic.</p><p>Example of counting apples: each community which can do this has a different ordered set of expressions (&ldquo;1,2,3&mldr;&rdquo;, &ldquo;$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$&mldr;&rdquo;, etc). But each community says there is the same count of apples. It seems like it is up to us how to count the apples but the actual count is vocabulary independent.</p><p>It&rsquo;s through understanding relationships between the vocabularies that we can achieve something vocabulary independent (e.g. the isomorphism between &ldquo;1,2,3&mldr;&rdquo; and &ldquo;$\alpha,\beta,\gamma$&mldr;&rdquo;).</p><p>You say &ldquo;it weighs 1&rdquo; and I say &ldquo;no it ways 2.2&rdquo; - what has to be true about our practice for someone outside us to say &ldquo;they are both measuring <em>the (objective) weight</em> (with units lb and kg)&rdquo;.
