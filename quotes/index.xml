To claim that the relationship between the framework of sense contents and that of physical objects can be construed on the phenomalist model1 is to commit oneself to the idea that there are inductively confirmable generalizations2 about sense contents which are in principle capable of being formulated without the language of physical things.</description></item><item><title>Depsychologizing</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Depsychologizing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Depsychologizing/</guid><description>Author
We know the efforts of such philosophers as Frege and Husserl to undo the &amp;ldquo;psychologizing&amp;rdquo; of logic (like Kant’s undoing Hume’s psychologizing of knowledge)1: now, the shortest way I might describe such a book as the Philosophical Investigations is to say that it attempts to undo the psychologizing of psychology, to show the necessity controlling our application of psychological and behavioral categories; even, one could say, show the necessities in human action and passion themselves.</description></item><item><title>Describing and explaining</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-and-explaining/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-and-explaining/</guid><description>Author
Although describing and explaining are distinguishable, they are also in an important sense inseparable. The descripitive and explanatory resources of language advance hand-in-hand.</description></item><item><title>Describing without modality</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-without-modality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-without-modality/</guid><description>Author
The idea that the world can in principle be so described that the description contains no modal expressions is of a piece with the idea that world can in principle be so described such that the description contains no prescriptive expressions.</description></item><item><title>Exemplification</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Exemplification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Exemplification/</guid><description>Author
Exemplification is a ‘quasi-semantical’ relation, and it (and universals1) are “in the world” only in that broad sense in which the ‘world’ includes linguistic norms and roles viewed (thus in translating) from the standpoint of a fellow participant.</description></item><item><title>Expressions as explanations</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Expressions-as-explanations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Expressions-as-explanations/</guid><description>Author
To make firsthand use of modal expressions / subjunctive conditionals, is to be about the business of explaining a state of affairs or justifying an assertion.</description></item><item><title>Goal of philosophy</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Goal-of-philosophy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Goal-of-philosophy/</guid><description>Author
The aim of philosophy is to understand how things, in the broadest possible sense of the term, hang together, in the broadest possible sense of the term.</description></item><item><title>Judgment in the order of explanation</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Judgment-in-the-order-of-explanation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Judgment-in-the-order-of-explanation/</guid><description>Author
Kant was on the right track when he insisted that, just as concepts are essentially (not accidentally) items which can occur in judgments, so judgments (and therefore indirectly concepts) are items that occur essentially (not accidentally) that occur in reasonings or arguments.</description></item><item><title>Labels vs describing</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Labels-vs-describing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Labels-vs-describing/</guid><description>Author
It&amp;rsquo;s only because the expressions in terms of which we describe objects, locate those objects in a space of implications that they describe it all rather than merely label.</description></item><item><title>Labels vs descriptions</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Labels-vs-descriptions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Labels-vs-descriptions/</guid><description>Author

My fundamental idea is that the ‘logical constants’ are not representatives; that there can be no representatives of the logic of facts</description></item><item><title>Man as rational animal</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Man-as-rational-animal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Man-as-rational-animal/</guid><description>Author
To say that man is a rational animal is to say that man is a creature not of habits but of rules.</description></item><item><title>Mobile army of metaphors</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mobile-army-of-metaphors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mobile-army-of-metaphors/</guid><description>Author
Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, transferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid, canonical, and binding to a nation.</description></item><item><title>Nondescriptive concepts</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Nondescriptive-concepts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Nondescriptive-concepts/</guid><description>Author
Once the tautology &amp;rsquo;the world is described by descriptive concepts&amp;rsquo; is freed from the idea that the business of all non-logical1 concepts is to describe, the way is clear to an ungrudging recognition that many expressions which empiricists have relegated to second-class citizenship in discourse are not inferior, they&amp;rsquo;re just different.</description></item><item><title>On community</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/On-community/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/On-community/</guid><description>Author
To say that a person desired to do A, thought it his duty to do B, but was forced to do C, is not to describe him as one might describe a scientific specimen.</description></item><item><title>Ontology and grammar</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Ontology-and-grammar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Ontology-and-grammar/</guid><description>Author

Our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually, but only as a corporate body.</description></item><item><title>Rules are lived</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rules-are-lived/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rules-are-lived/</guid><description>Author
A rule, properly speaking, isn&amp;rsquo;t a rule unless it lives in behavior, rule-regulated behavior. Even rule-violating behavior. Linguistically we always operate within a framework of living rules.</description></item><item><title>Scienta mensura</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Scienta-mensura/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Scienta-mensura/</guid><description>Author
In the dimension of describing and explaining the world, science is the measure of all of things. Of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not.</description></item><item><title>Space of reasons</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Space-of-reasons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Space-of-reasons/</guid><description>Author
In characterizing an episode or a state as knowing, we are not giving an empirical description of it. We are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one says.</description></item><item><title>Subjunctive conditionals as essential</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Subjunctive-conditionals-as-essential/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Subjunctive-conditionals-as-essential/</guid><description>Author
We&amp;rsquo;ve established not only that subjunctive conditionals are the expressions of material rules of inference, but that the authority of those rules is not derivative from formal rules.</description></item><item><title>Theoretical vs obserable objects - Pluto</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Theoretical-vs-obserable-objects-Pluto/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Theoretical-vs-obserable-objects-Pluto/</guid><description>Author
&amp;hellip; according to Sellars’s view, the distinction between theoretical objects and observable objects is methodological, rather than ontological. That is, theoretical and observable objects are not different kinds of thing.</description></item><item><title>Transition to conceptual thinking</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Transition-to-conceptual-thinking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Transition-to-conceptual-thinking/</guid><description>Author
Anything which can properly be called &amp;lsquo;conceptual thinking&amp;rsquo; can occur only within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which it can be criticized, supported, refuted (in short, evaluated).</description></item><item><title>Transposed language of norms</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Transposed-language-of-norms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Transposed-language-of-norms/</guid><description>Author
The language of modalities is … a “transposed” language of norms. &amp;hellip; Modal terms, normative terms and psychological terms are mutually irreducible.</description></item></channel></rss>
