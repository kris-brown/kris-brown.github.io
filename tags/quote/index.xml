It is an advantage of the anti-representationalist view of belief which James took over from Bain and Peirce&amp;ndash;the view that beliefs are habits of action&amp;ndash;that it frees us from the responsibility to unify all our beliefs into a single world-view.</description></item><item><title>Better off without Philosophy</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Better-off-without-Philosophy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Better-off-without-Philosophy/</guid><description>Author
&amp;ldquo;Intuition&amp;rdquo; is just the latest name for a device which will get us off the literary-historical- anthropological-political merry-go-round which such intellectuals ride, and onto something &amp;ldquo;progressive&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;scientific&amp;rdquo; -a device which will get us from philosophy to Philosophy.</description></item><item><title>C I Lewis on the a priori</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/C-I-Lewis-on-the-a-priori/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/C-I-Lewis-on-the-a-priori/</guid><description>[[Cheryl Misak|Author]
The a priori, on the other hand, is the “uncompelled initiative of human thought”. It is a conceptual framework or network of categories and definitive concepts.</description></item><item><title>Consequence of holism</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Consequence-of-holism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Consequence-of-holism/</guid><description>Author
Then the notion of philosophy as the discipline which looks for privileged representations among those constituting the Mirror becomes unintelligible.</description></item><item><title>Describing without modality</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-without-modality/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Describing-without-modality/</guid><description>Author
The idea that the world can in principle be so described that the description contains no modal expressions is of a piece with the idea that world can in principle be so described such that the description contains no prescriptive expressions.</description></item><item><title>Desirability of post-Philosophical culture</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Desirability-of-post-Philosophical-culture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Desirability-of-post-Philosophical-culture/</guid><description>Author
So the question of whether such a post-Philosophical culture is desirable can also be put as the question:&amp;hellip; Can we see ourselves as never encountering reality except under a chosen description&amp;hellip; the question of whether we can give up what Stanley Cavell calls the impossibility that one among endless true descriptions of me tells who I am.</description></item><item><title>Dismissing Kantian distinctions</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Dismissing-Kantian-distinctions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Dismissing-Kantian-distinctions/</guid><description>Author
This attitude toward the concept of &amp;ldquo;concept&amp;rdquo; makes it possible to dismiss Kant&amp;rsquo;s distinction between necessary truths (which can be determined by looking at concepts alone [analytic truth] or pure concepts and pure forms of intuition alone [synthetic a priori truth]) and contingent truths (which require reference to empirical intuitions).</description></item><item><title>End of analytic philosophy</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/End-of-analytic-philosophy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/End-of-analytic-philosophy/</guid><description>Author
On the account of recent analytic philosophy which I offered in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, the history of that movement has been marked by a gradual &amp;ldquo;pragmaticisation&amp;rdquo; of the original tenets of logical positivism.</description></item><item><title>Grounding justification</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Grounding-justification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Grounding-justification/</guid><description>Author
The issue is not adequacy of explanation of fact, but rather whether a practice of justification can be given a &amp;ldquo;grounding&amp;rdquo; in fact.</description></item><item><title>Idealism and textualism</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Idealism-and-textualism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Idealism-and-textualism/</guid><description>Author
I have been saying, first, that idealism and textualism have in common an opposition to the claim of science to be a paradigm of human activity, and, second, that they differ in that one is a philosophical doctrine and the other an expression of suspicion about philosophy.</description></item><item><title>Lewis picks Peirce over James</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Lewis-picks-Peirce-over-James/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Lewis-picks-Peirce-over-James/</guid><description>[[Cheryl Misak|Author]
In the great debate between Peirce and James, he sides with Peirce (whose papers he “lived with” for two years upon arrival at Harvard as a faculty member): “When we determine truth, we determine that which it is correct to believe and that upon which it is desirable (not merely desired) to act”.</description></item><item><title>Mirror of nature</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mirror-of-nature/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mirror-of-nature/</guid><description>Author
The picture which holds traditional philosophy captive is that of the mind as a great mirror, containing various representations-some accurate, some not-and capable of being studied by pure, nonempirical methods.</description></item><item><title>Mobile army of metaphors</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mobile-army-of-metaphors/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Mobile-army-of-metaphors/</guid><description>Author
Truth is a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, transferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid, canonical, and binding to a nation.</description></item><item><title>Moving beyond the onto-theological tradition</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Moving-beyond-the-onto-theological-tradition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Moving-beyond-the-onto-theological-tradition/</guid><description>Author
My principal motive is the belief that we can still make admirable sense of our lives even if we cease to have what Nagel calls &amp;ldquo;an ambition of transcendence.</description></item><item><title>On contingency</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/On-contingency/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/On-contingency/</guid><description>Author
I prefer this third way of characterizing pragmatism because it seems to me to focus on a fundamental choice which con- fronts the reflective mind: that between accepting the contingent character of starting points, and attempting to evade this contingency.</description></item><item><title>Peirce on genuine belief</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Peirce-on-genuine-belief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Peirce-on-genuine-belief/</guid><description>[[Cheryl Misak|Author]
Peirce’s point is that a genuine belief—one that is aimed at truth—is such that it resigns in the face of recalcitrant experience or in the knowledge that it was put into place by a method that did not take experience seriously.</description></item><item><title>Polytheism</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Polytheism/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Polytheism/</guid><description>Author
You are a polytheist if you think that there is no actual or possible object of knowledge which would permit you to commensurate and rank all human needs.</description></item><item><title>Pragmatism as lack of constraint</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Pragmatism-as-lack-of-constraint/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Pragmatism-as-lack-of-constraint/</guid><description>Author
Let me sum up by offering a third and final characterization of pragmatism: it is the doctrine that there are no constraints on inquiry save conversational ones &amp;ndash; no wholesale constraints derived from the nature of the objects, or of mind, or of language, but only those retail constraints provided by the remarks of our fellow-inqurirers.</description></item><item><title>Propositions not made true one-by-one</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Propositions-not-made-true-one-by-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Propositions-not-made-true-one-by-one/</guid><description>Author
Our statements about the external world face the tribunal of sense experience not individually, but only as a corporate body.</description></item><item><title>Realist vs pragmatist intuitions</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Realist-vs-pragmatist-intuitions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Realist-vs-pragmatist-intuitions/</guid><description>Author
This upshot of the confrontation between the pragmatist and the intuitive realist about the status of intuitions can be described either as a conflict of intuitions about the importance of intuitions, or as a preference for one vocabulary over another.</description></item><item><title>Rorty on James on truth</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rorty-on-James-on-truth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rorty-on-James-on-truth/</guid><description>Author
James&amp;rsquo; point, however, was that there is nothing to be said: truth is not the sort of thing which has an essence.</description></item><item><title>Rorty on neokantians</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rorty-on-neokantians/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/quotes/Rorty-on-neokantians/</guid><description>Author

Anything which can properly be called &amp;lsquo;conceptual thinking&amp;rsquo; can occur only within a framework of conceptual thinking in terms of which it can be criticized, supported, refuted (in short, evaluated).</description></item></channel></rss>
