Main question: does what we ordinarily say/mean have a direct+deep control over what we can philosophically say/mean? Goal: respond to objections to the methodology of &amp;lsquo;ordinary language philosophy&amp;rsquo; (by Mates) Distinguish 3 kinds of statements about ordinary language * Statements which produce instances of what is said in a language &amp;ldquo;We do say &amp;hellip; but we don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We ask whether &amp;hellip; but we don&amp;rsquo;t ask whether &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Like above, but with explications &amp;ldquo;When we say &amp;hellip;, we imply/suggest/say &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;hellip; unless we mean &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Generalizations, tested by reference to the first two types Working example: disagreement between Austin and Ryle * Austin: &amp;ldquo;We say &amp;lsquo;The gift was made voluntarily&amp;rsquo; &amp;quot; (type 1) Ryle: &amp;ldquo;It makes sense&amp;hellip; to ask whether a boy was responsible for breaking a window, but not whether he was responsible for finishing his homework in good time&amp;rdquo; (type 1) Ryle: &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;voluntary&amp;rsquo;/&amp;lsquo;involuntary&amp;rsquo; are applied as adjectives to actions which ought not be done&amp;rdquo; (type 3) Praise of Ryle&amp;rsquo;s generalization: Philosophical use of &amp;ldquo;voluntary&amp;rdquo; is distinct/disconnected from &amp;ldquo;volition&amp;rdquo; People think confusedly as if everything is either appropriately described as voluntary or involuntary Criticism of Ryle&amp;rsquo;s generalization: Saying there must be something morally fishy about the action that is described as voluntary is not general enough.</description></item><item><title>What the Tortoise said to Achilles</title><link>https://kris-brown.github.io/works/What-the-Tortoise-said-to-Achilles/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 1969 16:31:35 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://kris-brown.github.io/works/What-the-Tortoise-said-to-Achilles/</guid><description>Written by Lewis Caroll in 1895.
